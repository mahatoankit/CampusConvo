{"id": "sunway_32", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/ai-crop-disease-prediction/", "title": "No Title", "content": "AI Crop Disease Prediction: Revolutionizing Farming The farming world has always been at the mercy of nature. While farming has seen impressive success through modern practices in improving yield, pest control, and weather management, one constant threat always lingers over agriculture: crop disease. Whether rust in wheat, blight in potato, or mildew in grape, crop disease has long been a thorn in the flesh for farmers. Crop diseases can completely destroy harvests, wiping out small-scale and large-scale farms equally. But what if we could predict crop diseases before they are an issue, allowing farmers to respond to the very first indications that something is amiss. That’s where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in. With the incorporation of advanced machine learning algorithms, image recognition, and real-time data, AI is turning farmers into disease detectives-identifying potential problems well ahead of time before they get out of hand. Let us take a closer look at how AI is revolutionizing the prediction, control, and prevention of crop disease. The Challenge of Crop Diseases Before explaining how AI helps, one needs to understand the scope and magnitude of crop disease. Crop disease is the cause of an astronomical amount of loss of food worldwide annually. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates plant diseases as being to blame for as much as 40% of global crop loss-loss that translates to direct crop damage and cost of pesticides and disease control. Farmers usually rely on a combination of visual inspections, expert judgment, and weather forecasts to predict and manage diseases. But these controls are usually too late or are not specific enough. Diseases are apt to become uncontrollable fast, especially in large fields, and by the time they have been detected, it is too late to avert the harm. Traditional Methods of Disease Detection The ways of detecting crop diseases in the past were fairly primitive: Expert or farmer visual inspections that can easily miss early signs. Field sampling wherein parts of crops are being sent to labs to be analyzed, a slow process that may or may not deliver real-time feedback. Weather predictions, used to identify conditions (rain, temperature, humidity) favorable to disease epidemics, but without information on whether or not a crop in a specific region is indeed infected. These techniques are not as proactive but are rather reactive, and they are normally infested with human elements, lapses in time, and the sheer magnitude of modern-day farms. AI: The Disease Detective Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML), introduces a revolutionized approach to the problem of crop diseases. Machine learning is a branch of AI that enables systems to learn from experience, become more intelligent with time, and take decisions autonomously with minimal human intervention. It can be utilized in agriculture to recognize patterns, predict future events, and generate implementable outcomes. This is how AI is transforming the prediction of crop diseases: 1. Image Recognition for Early Disease Detection One of the most powerful uses of AI in agriculture is image recognition. Crops are captured in high-resolution photos by drones, satellites, and even hand-held cameras. The photos are fed into AI algorithms that have been programmed to see even the smallest indication of disease-often before the human eye can do so. For example: Leaf spots, a first indication of disease, may be identified in an image by machine learning algorithms that have been trained to recognize patterns in leaf shape, texture, and color. Innovative machine learning algorithms can even identify discoloration or wilting symptoms of infection caused by fungi or bacteria through images of the plant. The beauty is that this process can be scaled up. AI can cut through thousands of images from drones or satellite imagery to detect possible outbreaks in real-time, thus allowing early intervention. 2. Predictive Analytics for Disease Forecasting It can also predict the outbreak of disease by analyzing huge ranges of data points. It does not just look for observable clues, but accounts for other variables like: Weather conditions-temperature, rainfall, humidity Soil conditions Crop type and variety Disease history data AI could then present a probability calculation of the occurrence of specific diseases in specific regions, depending on environmental factors and existing patterns from previous seasons. As an illustration, if an AI system detects a high-humidity, high-temperature scenario-ideal for fungal growth-it can initiate farmers to adopt preventive actions like the application of fungicides, adjustment of irrigation schedule, or inspection of vulnerable crop zones. 3. Machine Learning for Continuous Improvement Machine learning programs improve over time. With each new set of data, AI is more and more able to make accurate disease predictions. The more it looks at pictures and the more it consumes from the world around it, the more it will see pre-symptomatic indicators of crop disease. For instance, the deep learning models are usually applied to identify and classify diseases based on plant images. The model continuously learns from the feedback it receives. If the farmer identifies a disease (or not) correctly (or wrongly), the AI platform refines its idea of the disease and improves the predictions. 4. Integration with Internet of Things (IoT) Devices AI predictability is also enhanced when merged with IoT devices on the farm. IoT devices are able to monitor environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real time. When merged with drone or satellite data, the real-time information stream gives the AI system the context of each crop, which makes the disease predictions even more precise. For example, the soil sensors may register low nitrogen levels, a stress factor that can predispose crops to disease infection. The AI system may suggest a specific remedy, for example, the application of fertilizers to boost the plants’ health. Benefits of Using AI for Disease Prediction The impact of using AI for forecasting crop disease is gigantic. Let us consider the most important advantages: 1. Preemptive Disease Management The strongest attribute of AI in the prediction of diseases is to act before a disease becomes entrenched. The traditional way is to react after diseases begin to spread. In contrast, AI allows farmers to catch problems early, at a stage when they can still avoid massive damage. 2. Targeted Interventions Through the application of AI, farmers will be in a position to make more fact-based, informed choices. Instead of spraying fungicides or pesticides over an entire field, AI will determine where the disease is most likely to appear. This makes for better-targeted use of chemicals, saving cash and cutting back on environmental damage. 3. Higher Yield and Lower Losses Disease detection with AI leads to healthier plants and ultimately higher yields. Because the farmers are able to prevent the worst of the disease, they are less likely to incur crushing crop loss, which translates into greater profitability. 4. Cost Savings Prevention of an outbreak of disease is far less expensive than addressing its effects. By accurate prediction of where and when a disease will appear, farmers do not waste money on treatments that are expensive, labor, and replanting. 5. Sustainability Disease forecasting using AI renders agriculture more sustainable by reducing the reliance on high pesticide application and soil fertility. It not only reduces the environmental footprint of agriculture, but also the risk of chemical resistance in pests and diseases is minimized. Real-World Examples of AI in Crop Disease Prediction Plantix (Germany) Plantix, a mobile application for plant health, uses AI and image recognition to help farmers diagnose crop diseases. Farmers take a photo of their plants, and the AI checks the image for disease, pest, or nutrient deficiency. The app then recommends treatment and connects farmers with experts. IBM Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture IBM’s platform uses AI, weather information, and block-chain to allow farmers to foresee and plan against diseases. The platform’s AI uses historical and real-time data and provides predictions on crop health along with recommending specific actions for disease prevention. Crop sensor (USA) Crop sensor uses AI-powered drones and sensors to monitor the health of the crops. AI algorithms analyze the data and predict the likely eruption of diseases and give farmers an early beginning for disease control. The Future of AI in Crop Disease Prediction The future of AI in crop disease prediction looks incredibly promising. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more powerful tools for disease prevention, including: Real-time drone surveillance with AI analysis on the go. More sophisticated weather models predicting disease risks. Automated disease management systems, where AI directly controls drones or sprayers to apply treatments only where needed. The intersection of AI and agriculture isn’t just about making farming more efficient; it’s about saving the planet’s food supply, one smart prediction at a time. Conclusion Artificial Intelligence is transforming crop disease management for farmers by delivering solutions that not only warn when the disease will strike, but also pre-empt its occurrence in the first place. Through predictive analytics, machine learning, and pre-emptive warning, farmers today are more empowered than ever to safeguard their crops, reduce waste, and enhance yield. With advancements in this technology along the lines they’re currently headed, there’s no question that AI will be a part of the future of agriculture-helping us feed more people on this planet more sustainably and efficiently. Agriculturists do not need to wait for the diseases to manifest themselves before acting. With AI, they are able to get ahead and keep their crops-and their businesses-disease-free in the next few years. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Like many nations, Nepal is awakening to this transformative power and grappling with how best to harness it for national development while mitigating potential risks. The recent unveiling of the draft National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy 2081 (corresponding to 2025 AD) signals a significant step in this direction. But is this initial stride enough? This post delves into the current state of AI policy in Nepal. Similarly, identifies crucial missing pieces. Also, explores the necessary next steps to build a robust and beneficial AI ecosystem for the nation, and also speaks about Nepal’s AI policy. The Current Landscape: Nepal’s Initial Steps into AI Governance Nepal’s journey towards formal AI governance isn’t starting from scratch. The Digital Nepal Framework 2076 (2019 AD) laid some groundwork, emphasizing AI, big data, and cloud computing. It worked as a key technological pillar for the nation’s digital transformation. Building on this, the draft National AI Policy 2081, released for public consultation by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MoCIT) in early 2025, marks a dedicated effort to create a strategic framework for AI. Key Highlights of the Draft Policy: Visionary Goals: The policy sets a vision for AI-driven digital transformation, aiming to integrate AI into key economic and social sectors like agriculture, healthcare, tourism, education, and governance to boost productivity and align with national development goals. Institutional Framework: It proposes creating new bodies to guide and regulate AI: National AI Center: To serve as the primary regulatory body overseeing AI growth, usage, and research. AI Regulation Council: Headed by the MoCIT Minister, focusing on ethical oversight, ensuring AI benefits society while respecting human rights and privacy, and aligning with international standards. AI Excellence Centers: To be established in universities and research institutions at national and provincial levels to foster R&D, focusing on ethical data handling and priority sectors. Infrastructure and Ethics: The policy acknowledges the need for expanding digital infrastructure (like 5G, fiber optics, data centers, cloud services) and places a strong emphasis on ethical AI development and regulation. While government-led initiatives are nascent, Nepal’s private sector shows glimpses of AI adoption. Startups like Fuse machines Nepal and Paaila Technology are working on AI-driven solutions in areas like chatbots, automation, and data analytics, particularly in finance, e-commerce, and potentially healthcare. However, this growth remains somewhat limited, often happening in pockets rather than as part of a coordinated national strategy. Identifying the Gaps: What’s Missing in Nepal’s AI Policy Strategy? Despite the commendable intentions laid out in the draft policy, several critical gaps and challenges need addressing for Nepal to effectively leverage AI. 1. The Implementation Chasm : The draft policy outlines ambitious goals but according to analysis, lacks a concrete roadmap. Crucial details regarding responsible agencies, specific funding mechanisms, timelines, and measurable outcomes are missing. Without these, there’s a significant risk of the policy remaining largely aspirational, confined to paper rather than practice. 2. Foundational Weaknesses: Infrastructure & Data: AI thrives on data and robust infrastructure. Nepal faces significant hurdles here: Infrastructure Deficit: Limited high-speed internet penetration, unreliable electricity supply, and inadequate access to advanced computing power and data centers severely restrict AI development and deployment. Data Governance: While the policy mentions data, it needs more explicit policies on data governance, including data quality standards, cleansing, security protocols, privacy protection, and clear regulations for cross-border data sharing. 3. The R&D and Skills Deficit: Meaningful AI development requires strong research capabilities and a skilled workforce. Underfunded R&D: Nepal invests less than 1% of its GDP in research and development, leaving institutions under-resourced. The draft policy encourages university collaboration and research centers, but without a clear financing strategy for AI labs and R&D hubs, Nepal may remain dependent on foreign technology. Talent Gap & Awareness: There’s a recognized shortage of AI professionals and low AI literacy among the broader population. Building a skilled workforce through dedicated educational programs and raising public awareness are critical yet underdeveloped areas. 4. Regulatory Vagueness and Ethical Implementation: While the draft mentions ethics and proposes a council, the governance section needs more teeth. Clearer guidelines are needed on transparency, accountability, bias mitigation, cybersecurity standards, data privacy enforcement (beyond just confidentiality, integrity, availability), and preventing misuse for surveillance or disinformation. The policy needs a well-defined, applicable definition of AI and a comprehensive glossary. 5. Stimulating the Ecosystem : The policy mentions public-private partnerships (PPPs) but lacks concrete details on incentives to encourage private sector investment and AI entrepreneurship. Tax breaks, startup grants, venture capital matching schemes, and dedicated innovation hubs are needed to catalyze the ecosystem, like approaches in countries like India or Singapore. 6. Localization Lag : For AI to be truly inclusive and effective across Nepal, solutions need to be developed and adapted for Nepali and other regional languages and contexts. Charting the Path Forward: What’s Next for Nepal’s AI Policy? Addressing these gaps requires a concerted and strategic effort. The following steps are crucial for Nepal’s AI journey: 1. Finalize and Operationalize the Policy : Incorporate stakeholder feedback (including recommendations from bodies like the CAN Federation) into the draft policy. Most importantly, translate the finalized policy into a clear, actionable, and funded implementation plan with defined roles, responsibilities, and timelines. 2. Build the Bedrock Infrastructure First: Prioritize substantial investment in core digital infrastructure: reliable power, nationwide high-speed internet, and secure, state-of-the-art data centers and cloud capabilities. This is non-negotiable for any serious AI ambition. 3. Invest in People and Ideas: Dramatically increase funding for AI research and development. Establish and adequately resource the proposed AI Excellence Centers. Integrate AI into university curricula, offer scholarships, and launch nationwide AI literacy and upskilling programs. 4. Develop Robust Legal & Ethical Guardrails : Craft clear, specific, and enforceable regulations covering data protection, cybersecurity, ethical AI principles (fairness, transparency, accountability), and responsible AI use. Ensure these legal frameworks protect citizens’ rights while fostering innovation. 5. Catalyze Collaboration and Investment: Design and implement attractive incentives for private sector AI development, startups, and PPPs. Foster a collaborative environment between government, academia, industry, and civil society. Explore strategic international partnerships, potentially learning from models like the Singapore-Rwanda AI Playbook for resource pooling. 6. Prioritize Localization and Sectoral Impact: Actively support the development of AI tools tailored to Nepal’s linguistic and cultural diversity. Continue focusing AI applications on key sectors (agriculture, health, education, disaster management) where they can deliver maximum societal and economic benefits. Artificial Intelligence holds immense potential to accelerate Nepal’s development, enhance public services, and create new economic opportunities. The draft National AI Policy 2081 is a vital first step, signaling the government’s commitment. However, a policy document alone is insufficient. Real work lies ahead: bridging the gap between ambition and action. This requires moving beyond broad statements to concrete implementation plans. Additionally, securing dedicated funding, building foundational infrastructure, nurturing local talent, establishing clear ethical and legal frameworks, and fostering a vibrant ecosystem through collaboration and smart incentives. By addressing the missing pieces and strategically charting the next steps, Nepal can harness the power of AI. It can harness not just to keep pace with the world, but to build a more prosperous and inclusive future. Also, it can harness a resilient future for all its citizens. The journey requires a collective effort, and the government should unite the industry, academia, and the public. It should unite towards a shared vision of responsible and impactful AI development.

{"id": "sunway_34", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/blockchain-nepal-context-beyond-crypto/", "title": "No Title", "content": "Blockchain in Nepal: Beyond Crypto & Towards a Digital Future Introduction: Why Blockchain, Why Now? As the world moves forward with new technologies, Nepal isn’t staying too far behind. We’re seeing more people talk about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning every day, and slowly but surely, Nepal is adopting them too. But here’s something you don’t hear as often-what about blockchain? Why isn’t blockchain getting the same attention in Nepal? Is it just because cryptocurrency is banned here? In this blog, I want to explore the potential of blockchain in Nepal-beyond just crypto. We’ll look at how it works, what’s already happening, and why it could be a game-changer for our country. So, here’s the big question: Is blockchain the tool that can help Nepal grow stronger, smarter, and fairer? What is Blockchain, Really? At a glance, blockchain is an application of Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT). At its core, it’s a digital ledger-a secure, decentralized system that records transactions across a network of computers. Unlike traditional databases controlled by central authorities, blockchain is transparent, tamper-resistant, and maintained collectively by its participants. Though Bitcoin popularized the term, blockchain technology’s potential goes far beyond cryptocurrencies. From tracking supply chains to securing elections, blockchain is a paradigm shift in how data is stored, verified, and trusted. How Does Blockchain Actually Work? Think of blockchain like a shared Google Doc. Everyone has access, everyone can verify what’s been added, but no one can erase or rewrite history. Each block in the chain is a digital record that contains a bundle of data or transactions. These blocks are arranged chronologically, and every block references the hash (a unique identifier) of the previous one. This creates a secure chain where changing a single block would require altering all subsequent ones-a virtually impossible feat without immense computational power. Here’s a simplified step-by-step breakdown: A transaction is requested. The transaction is broadcast to a peer-to-peer network. The network validates the transaction using algorithms. Once verified, the transaction is bundled into a block. The new block is added to the existing blockchain. The transaction is complete and permanently recorded. This structure ensures security, transparency, and immutability, making blockchain ideal for environments where trust and accountability are paramount. Use Cases and Pilot Projects in Nepal Nepal is already experimenting with blockchain in exciting ways: Agriculture AgriClear : This platform uses blockchain to track products from farm to table. Consumers can scan QR codes to verify the origin of goods like Jumla apples, ensuring quality and traceability. Rural Development Digital Village Initiative (FAO) : Municipalities like Kalinchowk, Rong, and Chhinnamasta are piloting digital tools, including blockchain-powered systems and IoT-enabled irrigation, to boost agricultural productivity and climate resilience. Education Academic Credential Verification : Blockchain is being explored to issue tamper-proof digital certificates. This would simplify verification for employers and reduce fraud in academic qualifications. These initiatives underscore Nepal’s proactive approach to using blockchain for sustainable development. Challenges to Adoption Despite early progress, several hurdles remain: Digital Infrastructure : Many rural regions lack reliable internet access. Policy & Regulation : Nepal currently has unclear or restrictive policies on cryptocurrency and blockchain-related ventures. Awareness & Expertise : Blockchain is still new to most educators, policymakers, and the public. Addressing these issues is critical for broader implementation. The Synergy of AI and Blockchain Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two of the most transformative technologies of our time. While they come from different roots, blockchain being a decentralized ledger system and AI being a decision-making and data analysis engine, their integration opens up powerful possibilities. Here’s how AI and blockchain complement each other: 1. Transparent Data Source : Blockchain provides clean, traceable data that AI can trust for training and analysis. Every data entry on a blockchain is verifiable, making it a reliable foundation for AI models. 2. Autonomous Systems : Decentralized AI can be built using blockchain. Instead of relying on a single server, AI operations can be distributed across multiple nodes, promoting autonomy and reducing single points of failure. 3. Privacy Protection : Blockchain’s cryptographic foundations protect data privacy during AI training and operations. This makes it safer to work with sensitive data while maintaining model performance. 4. Distributed Computing Power : AI requires vast computing resources. Blockchain helps by pooling distributed systems, reducing hardware costs, and balancing energy loads. 5. Enhanced Security : Smart contracts on blockchains can have vulnerabilities. AI can detect and prevent exploitation by improving the logic and resilience of these contracts. 6. Improved Data Handling : AI improves the efficiency of reading and querying blockchain data. Techniques like the TTA-CB protocol combined with optimization algorithms can make data storage and retrieval faster. 7. Authenticity & Auditability : AI decisions can be hard to explain. Blockchain helps by keeping an immutable log of data, model changes, and decision steps, supporting explainable AI and trust in its outputs. 8. Augmentation : AI adds intelligence to blockchain-based systems. It can process large datasets quickly and offer actionable insights, enabling smart automation and model sharing across networks. 9. Automation : Smart contracts can use AI to make real-time decisions-for example, choosing the most efficient shipping method or resolving disputes automatically. Together, AI and blockchain can create decentralized AI systems that are more transparent, secure, and scalable. From protecting healthcare data to improving logistics and enabling smart governance, their synergy is already shaping the future. Education and Awareness in Nepal Blockchain is still a relatively new concept for many in nepal, but awareness is slowly starting to grow among people. While as I stated at the beginning of this blog that this technology is often misunderstood as just “crypto”. Educational efforts are beginning to clarify its real-world potential. Some institutions like Kathmandu University have started offering introductory sessions and short courses on blockchain. These just cover the basics, how blockchain works, its use cases, adn tools like Ethereum, Solana and smart contracts. However, such programs are still limited and are mostly available in few urban universities There’s currently no dedicated undergraduate or postgraduate programs focused solely on blockchain technology. Most students still learn about it informally, through youtube, online courses or developers forums. Community and Events Nepal’s blockchain ecosystem is rapidly evolving, driven by a collaborative network of organizations and communities dedicated to education, innovation, and secure digital transformation. eSatya eSatya is a leading blockchain initiative in Nepal, dedicated to advancing blockchain education and development. In January 2025, eSatya hosted the “Bringing Devcon to Kathmandu” event, sponsored by Devcon as part of its Satellite Events funding round. The event featured screenings of Ethereum Devcon keynotes and facilitated discussions on Ethereum’s global impact, aiming to inspire local developers and enthusiasts . Additionally, eSatya offers a 12-week Blockchain Fellowship Program, supported by the Ethereum Foundation’s Ecosystem Support Program. This mentor-led course equips participants with practical skills in blockchain development, including smart contract creation and decentralized application (DApp) development. In the 2023 cohort, 17 out of 22 fellows successfully completed the program and presented their projects, such as blockchain-based digital health records and decentralized finance applications. HimalAI HimalAI is an emerging tech community in Nepal that focuses on integrating blockchain with artificial intelligence. In April 2025, HimalAI organized a 48-hour AI/Web3 Hackathon at the HimalAI Hacker House near Tribhuvan University in Kirtipur. The event brought together developers, data scientists, and entrepreneurs to collaborate on innovative solutions leveraging the combined power of AI and blockchain technologies. Participants competed for NPR 100,000 in prizes and engaged in workshops and keynotes covering topics such as AI tools, Web3 applications, data collection, and model fine-tuning . The hackathon aimed to foster a collaborative environment for building real-world solutions and advancing the tech ecosystem in Nepal. Blockchain Foundation Nepal serves as a community-driven platform, bringing together blockchain enthusiasts, developers, and professionals through regular meetups and discussions to explore blockchain-based solutions and foster an active blockchain community in Nepal. CryptoGen Nepal , a cybersecurity firm, plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem by ensuring the security of blockchain applications and infrastructure. Their services include IS audits, vulnerability assessments, and incident response, helping safeguard blockchain platforms against potential threats. Nepal Internet Governance Forum (Nepal IGF) is a multi stakeholder platform that discusses internet governance issues, including the development and regulation of emerging technologies like blockchain. By bringing together government, private sector, civil society, and technical community representatives, Nepal IGF facilitates dialogues that shape the future of internet and blockchain policies in the country. Together, these organizations are cultivating a robust blockchain ecosystem in Nepal, promoting education, innovation, and secure implementation of blockchain technologies across various sectors. Challenges Despite these efforts, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption and understanding onr blockchain in Nepal: Limited Formal Education: Blockchain technology is not yet a standard part of academic curricula in most educational institutions. Misconceptions: There is prevalent confucsion between blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, leading to skepticism and hesitancy in embracing blockchain solutions. Resource constraints: Access to necessary resources, such as computing infrastructures and expert mentorship, is limited, particularly in rural areas Future Opportunities for Nepal Nepal can unlock tremendous value with blockchain in areas like: Voting Systems : Secure, transparent digital voting. Land Registries : Immutable, accessible property records. Disaster Relief : Transparent fund allocation during emergencies. Tourism : Blockchain-based tourist identity and insurance solutions. With proper policy and public-private partnerships, Nepal can become a blockchain innovation hub in South Asia. Conclusion Nepal is not too late to the blockchain revolution in fact, it may be just on time. By embracing this technology strategically, we can foster transparency, fight corruption, and empower citizens from the Himalayas to the Terai. Let us not wait for revolutions to happen. Let us build them, block by block. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

{"id": "sunway_35", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/ai-future-work-whos-getting-replaced/", "title": "No Title", "content": "AI : Automation and Augmentation and the Future of Work. We are in a time when artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over our world, and its influence on the job market is generally taking a negative turn. You must have heard ominous statements: “AI is taking our jobs,” “Machines are making humans obsolete,” or “Automation means unemployment.” While such headlines are good clickbait material, they miss a fundamental point: AI isn’t so much eliminating jobs as it is transforming them. While it’s true that automation is revolutionizing the workforce, the idea that AI is taking human jobs overlooks a more subtle and hopeful reality. What’s really happening is that work roles are shifting, skills are evolving, and reskilling is the new norm. Instead of worrying about the rise of intelligent machines, we must prepare for a new era-one that appreciates flexibility, lifelong learning, and the unique value only humans can deliver. Let’s discuss AI, automation, and augmentation, and their differences. Understanding the Difference: Automation vs. Augmentation A popular myth is that AI will replace humans entirely. But AI doesn’t necessarily replace people in totality; it replaces tasks. To thoroughly understand the effect of AI on the job market, we need to differentiate between automation and augmentation. Automation implies the complete transfer of tasks from humans to machines. It is most certain to affect work that is repetitive, rule-based, and predictable-dare we say data entry, straightforward accounting, or routine factory work? Augmentation, on the contrary, is the utilization of artificial intelligence to enhance and supplement the capabilities of human workers. Decision-making, creativity, emotional intelligence, or strategic thinking is jobs that are less prone to be replaced and more apt to be augmented by AI. Take the field of medicine, for example. Radiologists are not being replaced by AI-they’re using it to read scans more quickly and accurately. Teachers are not being removed from the classroom-they’re using AI software to personalize lesson plans and cater to different learning styles. In most industries, AI is a collaborator, not an adversary. A widely-quoted McKinsey report estimates 60% of occupations have at least 30% of activities automated, and less than 5% of occupations are completely automated. That means the great majority of people won’t be losing their jobs to AI; rather, their jobs will change. Jobs at Risk, Jobs on the Rise. AI Behind? So, what are the real jobs in risk? It’s not so much jobs as a whole, but tasks within a job. Anything that entails hand-to-keyboard repetitive or mechanical procedures, it data entry clerks, telemarketers, or even parts of customer service-can be threatened by automation. Yet most other jobs are not just safe-they’re growing: AI/ML Engineers Data Scientists Cybersecurity Analysts Cloud Computing Specialists Digital Transformation Officers AI Ethics and Compliance Officers Even traditionally “low-tech” jobs are evolving. Marketing professionals, for example, now need to learn about data analytics. HR personnel are using AI tools for smarter hiring and employee retention strategies. What counts as “technical” is expanding, and hybrid roles that combine human and technical skills are in great demand. The Rise of Reskilling and Lifelong Learning One of the most profound changes AI is bringing to the workplace is the new focus on up-skilling and reskilling. Skills have an ever-shortening half-life. A skill learned five years ago might be obsolete today. The World Economic Forum estimates that 50% of all workers will need reskilling by 2025. How does this work out in practical life? Educational Digital Platforms Large web-based open course platforms like Coursera, DataCamp, edX, and Udemy are thriving. Individuals are gaining certificates in cloud computing, AI development, project management, and data analytics-let alone coding skills-within a few months or weeks. Corporate Reskilling Programs Leading companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM are investing heavily in internal upskilling programs. Amazon, to cite an excellent example, invested more than $700 million in reskilling 100,000 employees in emerging skills like machine learning and cloud computing. Public Sector Initiatives A few governments are also taking early action. Examples are Singapore’s SkillsFuture and Finland’s AI education program for all, which illustrate the role policy can play in enabling citizens to adjust to technological change. The key takeaway? Lifelong learning is no longer a luxury-it’s a necessity. Human Strengths in the Age of AI As computers get better at doing logical and computational tasks, those things that make us uniquely human are all the more valuable. AI can perhaps do complex equations and pattern recognition at scale-but it still cannot replicate emotional intelligence, creativity, critical thinking, and moral discernment. That’s where human beings continue to surpass: Creativity & Innovation: Though AI can produce text, it is impossible to generate ideas of cultural or emotional significance. The nursing care of a nurse who demonstrates empathy or the counseling provided by an exemplary teacher cannot be substituted by any system. Ethical Decision-Making: AI operates within defined parameters; it is not capable of solving ethical problems without human involvement. Contextual Understanding: Humans can comprehend subtleties, humor, sarcasm, and cultural references that machines fail to catch. The future of employment transcends the mere acquisition of coding skills; it encompasses the ability to coexist and collaborate with machines, while simultaneously emphasizing the qualities that render us uniquely human. Adaptability: The Ultimate Career Skill In the AI era, the single most valuable skill is not technical skill-it’s adaptability. The individuals who will thrive will be the ones who can change, learn new tools, and continue to adapt. To present a real-world example, one can look at the revolution taking place in the journalism sector. Initially, there were concerns that artificially generated news stories would displace human reporters. But the reality is far more complex. Journalists are now utilizing AI tools to rapidly produce first drafts, track public opinion, and identify emerging trends. Consequently, this technology enables them to devote more time to investigating journalism and deeper reporting. Similarly, customer service roles are changing. Chatbots handle FAQs, and human reps focus on high-empathy, high-complexity situations. In logistics, warehouse automation is creating roles for robotics supervisors and systems analysts. Goodbye to the ancient adage-specialize in one thing and that’s it for life. The new motto is: “Stay curious, stay flexible, stay learning.” A Global Perspective It’s also important to mention that AI impacts vary by geography. In wealthy nations, the uptake of AI is faster, but so are investments in digital infrastructure and re-skilling. In poorer nations, there’s more likelihood of job displacement without a safety net. Yet, global organizations are now turning their attention to inclusive AI development. The OECD, World Economic Forum, and UNESCO are championing AI policies that leave no one behind-especially women, minority communities, and employees in vulnerable industries. Final Thoughts: It’s Not AI vs. Humans-It’s AI with Humans The fear that artificial intelligence will “take our jobs” ignores the complexity of the changes that are underway. Yes, the character of work is changing, but this change does not mean the elimination of human labor. Rather, we are forced to rethink our identities, form new competencies, and envision a future in which technology enhances our abilities instead of replacing us. Instead of asking, “Will AI replace my job?” a more appropriate question is: How do I implement artificial intelligence to enhance my work performance? The future of work will not be man versus machine-it will be about co-creation, collaboration, and continuous growth. So, who is being replaced, then? Not the people. However, human activities refuse to move forward. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

{"id": "sunway_36", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/what-is-machine-learning-beginners-guide/", "title": "No Title", "content": "What is Machine Learning: A Beginner's Guide Have you ever wondered how Instagram seems to know exactly what reel you’d like next, or how your phone can recognize your face even when you’re smiling? It’s like these things just get you very well and know you so much (are our data being leaked....😅). Well, the secret to that magic is something that we call machine learning. It’s a technology sneaking its way into almost all aspects of our lives without us even realizing it. From the suggestions we get on social media to how doctors diagnose disease, machine learning is making the world around us work its magic. But what the question is, how does it do that, and where else is it being used? Let me help you break it down simply. What is Machine Learning? At its core, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn. Using ML, your PC can learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task, from math to reasoning and identifying objects. Instead of telling specific instructions to your computer to follow, like running a Python script to find a derivative of a number, we provide it with examples and let it figure it out by itself without us telling it. Additionally, the machine will learn based on the patterns it detects and understand itself based on what pattern it represents. Let’s think of it this way: rather than telling a computer step-by-step how to find a cat in a photo, we show it thousands of cat pictures and let it discover the visual patterns that make a cat a cat like its ears, whiskers, tail, and pointy ears. The machine will not be able to identify it in one shot, but as we show it thousands of photos of cats continuously, over time, the machine will start to learn the common patterns in the photo and can pick out a cat in a new photo based on the pattern it learned. How is Machine Learning Different from Traditional Programming? Traditional programming follows a straightforward approach: Input + Rules → Output Machine learning flips this process: Input + Output → Rules We give the system inputs (data) and desired outputs, and it learns the rules to transform one into the other. This is powerful because it means the computer can handle tasks that would be impossibly complex to code explicitly. Types of Machine Learning There are three main types: 1. Supervised Learning In supervised learning, we provide examples that are labeled. The machine learns to associate some inputs with some outputs. For example, to develop a spam filter, we might input an algorithm with hundreds of emails that are classified as “spam” or “not spam.” The algorithm learns about the features that distinguish spam mail from good mail. 2. Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning occurs when a model is trained on data without labels. The algorithm tries to learn the patterns or clusters within the data itself. Unsupervised learning can be employed by a retailer who wants to group customers into different categories based on what they buy without knowing beforehand what these groups will be. 3. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is a method whereby an agent is trained to make decisions based on the feedback provided by the environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for actions and learns to maximize rewards with time. This is how AlphaGo was instructed to play the board game of Go at the superhuman level, and robots learn to travel through intricate spaces. This is the reason why beating a chess bot is so hard, as it was trained under reinforcement learning. The Machine Learning Process A typical machine learning project follows these steps: Collect Data: Gather relevant data for your problem. Prepare Data: Clean and format the data so it’s usable. Choose a model: Select an appropriate algorithm for your task. Train the Model: Feed your data to the algorithm so it can learn patterns. Evaluate the Model: Test how well your model performs. Tune Parameters: Adjust settings so that they can improve performance. Make Predictions: Use your trained model on new data. Real-World Applications Machine learning powers many technologies we use daily: Virtual Assistants: Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use machine learning to understand and respond to voice commands. Recommendation Systems: Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon suggest content based on your preferences. Email Filtering: Gmail automatically sorts emails into primary, social, and promotional categories. Medical Diagnosis: Algorithms help doctors detect diseases from medical images. Fraud Detection: Banks use machine learning to identify suspicious transactions. Challenges in Machine Learning Despite its power, machine learning faces several challenges: Data Quality: Models are only as good as the data they’re trained on. Bias: If training data contains biases, the model will likely perpetuate them. Explainability: Complex models often function as “black boxes,” making it difficult to understand how they reach specific conclusions. Privacy Concerns: often requires large amounts of data, raising questions about data privacy. Getting Started with Machine Learning So now, if you’re interested in learning more about machine learning, here are some steps to get started: Learn the Basics: Understand fundamental concepts like algorithms, models, and evaluation metrics like how will your machine learn an image or predict, learn what models are there to train a machine learning model, and how to know if your machine is learning instead of mugging up everything. Study Statistics and Probability: These are the mathematical foundations of machine learning. Yup, math is needed to understand the algorithm I said too, so yes it is very important and we cannot skip this. Pick a Programming Language: Python is the most popular choice for machine learning due to its simplicity and robust libraries. Try Simple Projects: Start with beginner-friendly problems like predicting house prices or classifying images. You can use Kaggle to learn and do projects. Conclusion Machine learning is redefining how we solve issues in industries. By allowing computers to learn from data, we can solve complex problems that would be impossible with traditional programming techniques. The field is developing extremely rapidly, with new methods and applications consistently being discovered. If you’d like to integrate machine learning into your business or are considering doing so as a career, gaining an understanding of the fundamentals is the first step toward tapping its potential. As we advance into the future, machine learning will forever change our world in many exciting ways, making now a great time to dive into this cutting-edge technology.

Introduction: In the world of computers and the internet, most people compete with Mac and Windows, just like comparing iOS and Android not knowing there is something known as Linux. If you are a tech student or one into computers, you might have heard about Linux somewhere. If you’re new to Linux and want to understand why it’s gaining popularity, then this guide, “Linux for Beginners” is for you. Linux is a powerful, secure, and open-source operating system that has become a viable alternative to Windows and macOS. Whether you’re a student, developer, or casual user, Linux offers flexibility and customization to suit your needs. But where have you used it is the question. Those who have not used Linux or maybe have heard it for the first time should know why it is one of the greatest fields to explore. And if you think that it has a great field then why is it not being known as an alternative to Windows and ios, well in reality Linux is used more than these actually, the majority of the world’s cloud computing servers are Linux based. It is a dominating OS for web servers, database servers, and other applications that power the majority of internet services. It is also used in embedded systems like smartwatches, Bluetooth speakers, thermostats cars, and many more. The Android that the majority of you talk about is based on Linux itself, not just that more than 500 computers are using Linux as their operating system, and hackers or expert programmers prefer Linux compared to other OS. So the question arises should we switch to Linux? Should we switch to Linux? We just talked about Linux being used by hackers and developers, not just that I also told you guys about Linux being used in the supercomputer so it means Linux is really fast and cool right? Well not exactly. The majority of Linux is perceived faster because there is no such bloatware like Windows and is lightweight compared to MacOS, so the majority of tasks might feel better in performance compared to other OS but this will depend on your system. I told you about the system cause Linux runs on almost anything and I mean it. Let me tell you more about its advantages. Reasons to Choose Linux Security and Privacy Unlike Mac and Windows, Linux is far secure with strong security features such as no such things as forced updates which are the most irritating things in the majority of OS, and no bloatware and spyware. Unlike other OS, Linux does not track its users and try to fetch their user data, Linux instead provides you full control over the system and lets you decide what to do. One fun thing about is that the majority of viruses in the world are designed for either Windows or MacOS so by default there are very less viruses ever designed that work on Linux making it more secure Open Source and Free: I just told you about how Linux gives us whole control and is transparent to us and this is what developers love about it and thus call it Open source as we can get to know how it was made and how to configure it all on the internet and all for free. So instead of paying for licenses for OS like Windows and macOS, we can just get Linux for free. Just being free makes this a great choice for students and budget-conscious users Performance and Efficiency I talked about hardware to you and why I brought it was because Linux can run on almost all hardware, Linux is lightweight and optimized for performance making it a great choice to revive your old laptop that becomes buggy and slow due to Windows. Just install Linux and feel it as if it’s new. Things to remember before Downloading Linux as a beginner to Linux Hardware Compatibility: Personally, when I downloaded Linux on old hardware there were no such issues like this but when I switched to new-gen laptops a lot of problems arose such as hardware not supporting, divrives not responding and the keyboard not functioning. These are common in Linux as the Linux you download is not fully built according to your laptop but in general consideration of what a simple device looks, so as you get more new gen computer you need to switch to better Linux or download all the hardware and drivers to the current Linux which might be quite hard for new users. Software compatibility: Not just hardware and drivers, so many software are not compatible with Linux too for instance majority of editing software like MS Office, Adobe Platform, and more are not available in Linux normally, we need to hardcode and download them from a third, and still it may not support fully. While Linux does provide you alternatives to this application they may not be that good as you are familiar with the original ones in Windows and MacOS Gaming While Linux gaming has come a long way, many major games still don’t support Linux natively, and you may need Wine or Proton (via Steam) to run Windows-based games, which isn’t always perfect and can require extra configuration. Learning Curve Linux has a steeper learning curve, especially if you’re used to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Windows or macOS. The majority of you have not used a terminal at all and the majority have a GUI for everything so switching from that is hard. You might have to use the terminal (command line) for certain tasks, and troubleshooting often requires technical knowledge. It requires more and more manual setup which might be hard for first-time users. A Ray of Hope For the Passionate Ones With so harsh truth about Linux majority of people have already given up using Linux, but is it bad? Can we use Linux despite these hurdles? Absolutely. And today, we’re here to shine a light on why Linux is still worth it. It may not be a smooth ride but a ride you will always cherish.

{"id": "sunway_56", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/2025/06/", "title": "No Title", "content": "June 2025 - Sunway College Kathmandu The farming world has always been at the mercy of nature. While farming has seen impressive success through modern practices in improving yield, pest control, and weather management, one constant threat always lingers over agriculture: crop disease. Whether rust in wheat, blight in potato, or mildew in grape, crop disease has long been a thorn in the flesh for farmers. Crop diseases can completely destroy harvests, wiping out small-scale and large-scale farms equally. But what if we could predict crop diseases before they are an issue, allowing farmers to respond to the very first indications that something is amiss. That’s where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in. With the incorporation of advanced machine learning algorithms, image recognition, and real-time data, AI is turning farmers into disease detectives-identifying potential problems well ahead of time before they get out of hand. Let us take a closer look at how AI is revolutionizing the prediction, control, and prevention of crop disease. The Challenge of Crop Diseases Before explaining how AI helps, one needs to understand the scope and magnitude of crop disease. Crop disease is the cause of an astronomical amount of loss of food worldwide annually. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates plant diseases as being to blame for as much as 40% of global crop loss-loss that translates to direct crop damage and cost of pesticides and disease control. Farmers usually rely on a combination of visual inspections, expert judgment, and weather forecasts to predict and manage diseases. But these controls are usually too late or are not specific enough. Diseases are apt to become uncontrollable fast, especially in large fields, and by the time they have been detected, it is too late to avert the harm. Traditional Methods of Disease Detection The ways of detecting crop diseases in the past were fairly primitive: Expert or farmer visual inspections that can easily miss early signs. Field sampling wherein parts of crops are being sent to labs to be analyzed, a slow process that may or may not deliver real-time feedback. Weather predictions, used to identify conditions (rain, temperature, humidity) favorable to disease epidemics, but without information on whether or not a crop in a specific region is indeed infected. These techniques are not as proactive but are rather reactive, and they are normally infested with human elements, lapses in time, and the sheer magnitude of modern-day farms. AI: The Disease Detective Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML), introduces a revolutionized approach to the problem of crop diseases. Machine learning is a branch of AI that enables systems to learn from experience, become more intelligent with time, and take decisions autonomously with minimal human intervention. It can be utilized in agriculture to recognize patterns, predict future events, and generate implementable outcomes. This is how AI is transforming the prediction of crop diseases: 1. Image Recognition for Early Disease Detection One of the most powerful uses of AI in agriculture is image recognition. Crops are captured in high-resolution photos by drones, satellites, and even hand-held cameras. The photos are fed into AI algorithms that have been programmed to see even the smallest indication of disease-often before the human eye can do so. For example: Leaf spots, a first indication of disease, may be identified in an image by machine learning algorithms that have been trained to recognize patterns in leaf shape, texture, and color. Innovative machine learning algorithms can even identify discoloration or wilting symptoms of infection caused by fungi or bacteria through images of the plant. The beauty is that this process can be scaled up. AI can cut through thousands of images from drones or satellite imagery to detect possible outbreaks in real-time, thus allowing early intervention. 2. Predictive Analytics for Disease Forecasting It can also predict the outbreak of disease by analyzing huge ranges of data points. It does not just look for observable clues, but accounts for other variables like: Weather conditions-temperature, rainfall, humidity Soil conditions Crop type and variety Disease history data AI could then present a probability calculation of the occurrence of specific diseases in specific regions, depending on environmental factors and existing patterns from previous seasons. As an illustration, if an AI system detects a high-humidity, high-temperature scenario-ideal for fungal growth-it can initiate farmers to adopt preventive actions like the application of fungicides, adjustment of irrigation schedule, or inspection of vulnerable crop zones. 3. Machine Learning for Continuous Improvement Machine learning programs improve over time. With each new set of data, AI is more and more able to make accurate disease predictions. The more it looks at pictures and the more it consumes from the world around it, the more it will see pre-symptomatic indicators of crop disease. For instance, the deep learning models are usually applied to identify and classify diseases based on plant images. The model continuously learns from the feedback it receives. If the farmer identifies a disease (or not) correctly (or wrongly), the AI platform refines its idea of the disease and improves the predictions. 4. Integration with Internet of Things (IoT) Devices AI predictability is also enhanced when merged with IoT devices on the farm. IoT devices are able to monitor environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real time. When merged with drone or satellite data, the real-time information stream gives the AI system the context of each crop, which makes the disease predictions even more precise. For example, the soil sensors may register low nitrogen levels, a stress factor that can predispose crops to disease infection. The AI system may suggest a specific remedy, for example, the application of fertilizers to boost the plants’ health. Benefits of Using AI for Disease Prediction The impact of using AI for forecasting crop disease is gigantic. Let us consider the most important advantages: 1. Preemptive Disease Management The strongest attribute of AI in the prediction of diseases is to act before a disease becomes entrenched. The traditional way is to react after diseases begin to spread. In contrast, AI allows farmers to catch problems early, at a stage when they can still avoid massive damage. 2. Targeted Interventions Through the application of AI, farmers will be in a position to make more fact-based, informed choices. Instead of spraying fungicides or pesticides over an entire field, AI will determine where the disease is most likely to appear. This makes for better-targeted use of chemicals, saving cash and cutting back on environmental damage. 3. Higher Yield and Lower Losses Disease detection with AI leads to healthier plants and ultimately higher yields. Because the farmers are able to prevent the worst of the disease, they are less likely to incur crushing crop loss, which translates into greater profitability. 4. Cost Savings Prevention of an outbreak of disease is far less expensive than addressing its effects. By accurate prediction of where and when a disease will appear, farmers do not waste money on treatments that are expensive, labor, and replanting. 5. Sustainability Disease forecasting using AI renders agriculture more sustainable by reducing the reliance on high pesticide application and soil fertility. It not only reduces the environmental footprint of agriculture, but also the risk of chemical resistance in pests and diseases is minimized. Real-World Examples of AI in Crop Disease Prediction Plantix (Germany) Plantix, a mobile application for plant health, uses AI and image recognition to help farmers diagnose crop diseases. Farmers take a photo of their plants, and the AI checks the image for disease, pest, or nutrient deficiency. The app then recommends treatment and connects farmers with experts. IBM Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture IBM’s platform uses AI, weather information, and block-chain to allow farmers to foresee and plan against diseases. The platform’s AI uses historical and real-time data and provides predictions on crop health along with recommending specific actions for disease prevention. Crop sensor (USA) Crop sensor uses AI-powered drones and sensors to monitor the health of the crops. AI algorithms analyze the data and predict the likely eruption of diseases and give farmers an early beginning for disease control. The Future of AI in Crop Disease Prediction The future of AI in crop disease prediction looks incredibly promising. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more powerful tools for disease prevention, including: Real-time drone surveillance with AI analysis on the go. More sophisticated weather models predicting disease risks. Automated disease management systems, where AI directly controls drones or sprayers to apply treatments only where needed. The intersection of AI and agriculture isn’t just about making farming more efficient; it’s about saving the planet’s food supply, one smart prediction at a time. Conclusion Artificial Intelligence is transforming crop disease management for farmers by delivering solutions that not only warn when the disease will strike, but also pre-empt its occurrence in the first place. Through predictive analytics, machine learning, and pre-emptive warning, farmers today are more empowered than ever to safeguard their crops, reduce waste, and enhance yield. With advancements in this technology along the lines they’re currently headed, there’s no question that AI will be a part of the future of agriculture-helping us feed more people on this planet more sustainably and efficiently. Agriculturists do not need to wait for the diseases to manifest themselves before acting. With AI, they are able to get ahead and keep their crops-and their businesses-disease-free in the next few years. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept; it’s a global force reshaping industries, economies, and daily life. From optimizing complex systems to personalizing user experiences, AI’s potential is undeniable. Like many nations, Nepal is awakening to this transformative power and grappling with how best to harness it for national development while mitigating potential risks. The recent unveiling of the draft National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy 2081 (corresponding to 2025 AD) signals a significant step in this direction. But is this initial stride enough? This post delves into the current state of AI policy in Nepal. Similarly, identifies crucial missing pieces. Also, explores the necessary next steps to build a robust and beneficial AI ecosystem for the nation, and also speaks about Nepal’s AI policy. The Current Landscape: Nepal’s Initial Steps into AI Governance Nepal’s journey towards formal AI governance isn’t starting from scratch. The Digital Nepal Framework 2076 (2019 AD) laid some groundwork, emphasizing AI, big data, and cloud computing. It worked as a key technological pillar for the nation’s digital transformation. Building on this, the draft National AI Policy 2081, released for public consultation by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MoCIT) in early 2025, marks a dedicated effort to create a strategic framework for AI. Key Highlights of the Draft Policy: Visionary Goals: The policy sets a vision for AI-driven digital transformation, aiming to integrate AI into key economic and social sectors like agriculture, healthcare, tourism, education, and governance to boost productivity and align with national development goals. Institutional Framework: It proposes creating new bodies to guide and regulate AI: National AI Center: To serve as the primary regulatory body overseeing AI growth, usage, and research. AI Regulation Council: Headed by the MoCIT Minister, focusing on ethical oversight, ensuring AI benefits society while respecting human rights and privacy, and aligning with international standards. AI Excellence Centers: To be established in universities and research institutions at national and provincial levels to foster R&D, focusing on ethical data handling and priority sectors. Infrastructure and Ethics: The policy acknowledges the need for expanding digital infrastructure (like 5G, fiber optics, data centers, cloud services) and places a strong emphasis on ethical AI development and regulation. While government-led initiatives are nascent, Nepal’s private sector shows glimpses of AI adoption. Startups like Fuse machines Nepal and Paaila Technology are working on AI-driven solutions in areas like chatbots, automation, and data analytics, particularly in finance, e-commerce, and potentially healthcare. However, this growth remains somewhat limited, often happening in pockets rather than as part of a coordinated national strategy. Identifying the Gaps: What’s Missing in Nepal’s AI Policy Strategy? Despite the commendable intentions laid out in the draft policy, several critical gaps and challenges need addressing for Nepal to effectively leverage AI. 1. The Implementation Chasm : The draft policy outlines ambitious goals but according to analysis, lacks a concrete roadmap. Crucial details regarding responsible agencies, specific funding mechanisms, timelines, and measurable outcomes are missing. Without these, there’s a significant risk of the policy remaining largely aspirational, confined to paper rather than practice. 2. Foundational Weaknesses: Infrastructure & Data: AI thrives on data and robust infrastructure. Nepal faces significant hurdles here: Infrastructure Deficit: Limited high-speed internet penetration, unreliable electricity supply, and inadequate access to advanced computing power and data centers severely restrict AI development and deployment. Data Governance: While the policy mentions data, it needs more explicit policies on data governance, including data quality standards, cleansing, security protocols, privacy protection, and clear regulations for cross-border data sharing. 3. The R&D and Skills Deficit: Meaningful AI development requires strong research capabilities and a skilled workforce. Underfunded R&D: Nepal invests less than 1% of its GDP in research and development, leaving institutions under-resourced. The draft policy encourages university collaboration and research centers, but without a clear financing strategy for AI labs and R&D hubs, Nepal may remain dependent on foreign technology. Talent Gap & Awareness: There’s a recognized shortage of AI professionals and low AI literacy among the broader population. Building a skilled workforce through dedicated educational programs and raising public awareness are critical yet underdeveloped areas. 4. Regulatory Vagueness and Ethical Implementation: While the draft mentions ethics and proposes a council, the governance section needs more teeth. Clearer guidelines are needed on transparency, accountability, bias mitigation, cybersecurity standards, data privacy enforcement (beyond just confidentiality, integrity, availability), and preventing misuse for surveillance or disinformation. The policy needs a well-defined, applicable definition of AI and a comprehensive glossary. 5. Stimulating the Ecosystem : The policy mentions public-private partnerships (PPPs) but lacks concrete details on incentives to encourage private sector investment and AI entrepreneurship. Tax breaks, startup grants, venture capital matching schemes, and dedicated innovation hubs are needed to catalyze the ecosystem, like approaches in countries like India or Singapore. 6. Localization Lag : For AI to be truly inclusive and effective across Nepal, solutions need to be developed and adapted for Nepali and other regional languages and contexts. Charting the Path Forward: What’s Next for Nepal’s AI Policy? Addressing these gaps requires a concerted and strategic effort. The following steps are crucial for Nepal’s AI journey: 1. Finalize and Operationalize the Policy : Incorporate stakeholder feedback (including recommendations from bodies like the CAN Federation) into the draft policy. Most importantly, translate the finalized policy into a clear, actionable, and funded implementation plan with defined roles, responsibilities, and timelines. 2. Build the Bedrock Infrastructure First: Prioritize substantial investment in core digital infrastructure: reliable power, nationwide high-speed internet, and secure, state-of-the-art data centers and cloud capabilities. This is non-negotiable for any serious AI ambition. 3. Invest in People and Ideas: Dramatically increase funding for AI research and development. Establish and adequately resource the proposed AI Excellence Centers. Integrate AI into university curricula, offer scholarships, and launch nationwide AI literacy and upskilling programs. 4. Develop Robust Legal & Ethical Guardrails : Craft clear, specific, and enforceable regulations covering data protection, cybersecurity, ethical AI principles (fairness, transparency, accountability), and responsible AI use. Ensure these legal frameworks protect citizens’ rights while fostering innovation. 5. Catalyze Collaboration and Investment: Design and implement attractive incentives for private sector AI development, startups, and PPPs. Foster a collaborative environment between government, academia, industry, and civil society. Explore strategic international partnerships, potentially learning from models like the Singapore-Rwanda AI Playbook for resource pooling. 6. Prioritize Localization and Sectoral Impact: Actively support the development of AI tools tailored to Nepal’s linguistic and cultural diversity. Continue focusing AI applications on key sectors (agriculture, health, education, disaster management) where they can deliver maximum societal and economic benefits. Artificial Intelligence holds immense potential to accelerate Nepal’s development, enhance public services, and create new economic opportunities. The draft National AI Policy 2081 is a vital first step, signaling the government’s commitment. However, a policy document alone is insufficient. Real work lies ahead: bridging the gap between ambition and action. This requires moving beyond broad statements to concrete implementation plans. Additionally, securing dedicated funding, building foundational infrastructure, nurturing local talent, establishing clear ethical and legal frameworks, and fostering a vibrant ecosystem through collaboration and smart incentives. By addressing the missing pieces and strategically charting the next steps, Nepal can harness the power of AI. It can harness not just to keep pace with the world, but to build a more prosperous and inclusive future. Also, it can harness a resilient future for all its citizens. The journey requires a collective effort, and the government should unite the industry, academia, and the public. It should unite towards a shared vision of responsible and impactful AI development. Introduction: Why Blockchain, Why Now? As the world moves forward with new technologies, Nepal isn’t staying too far behind. We’re seeing more people talk about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning every day, and slowly but surely, Nepal is adopting them too. But here’s something you don’t hear as often-what about blockchain? Why isn’t blockchain getting the same attention in Nepal? Is it just because cryptocurrency is banned here? In this blog, I want to explore the potential of blockchain in Nepal-beyond just crypto. We’ll look at how it works, what’s already happening, and why it could be a game-changer for our country. So, here’s the big question: Is blockchain the tool that can help Nepal grow stronger, smarter, and fairer? What is Blockchain, Really? At a glance, blockchain is an application of Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT). At its core, it’s a digital ledger-a secure, decentralized system that records transactions across a network of computers. Unlike traditional databases controlled by central authorities, blockchain is transparent, tamper-resistant, and maintained collectively by its participants. Though Bitcoin popularized the term, blockchain technology’s potential goes far beyond cryptocurrencies. From tracking supply chains to securing elections, blockchain is a paradigm shift in how data is stored, verified, and trusted. How Does Blockchain Actually Work? Think of blockchain like a shared Google Doc. Everyone has access, everyone can verify what’s been added, but no one can erase or rewrite history. Each block in the chain is a digital record that contains a bundle of data or transactions. These blocks are arranged chronologically, and every block references the hash (a unique identifier) of the previous one. This creates a secure chain where changing a single block would require altering all subsequent ones-a virtually impossible feat without immense computational power. Here’s a simplified step-by-step breakdown: A transaction is requested. The transaction is broadcast to a peer-to-peer network. The network validates the transaction using algorithms. Once verified, the transaction is bundled into a block. The new block is added to the existing blockchain. The transaction is complete and permanently recorded. This structure ensures security, transparency, and immutability, making blockchain ideal for environments where trust and accountability are paramount. Use Cases and Pilot Projects in Nepal Nepal is already experimenting with blockchain in exciting ways: Agriculture AgriClear : This platform uses blockchain to track products from farm to table. Consumers can scan QR codes to verify the origin of goods like Jumla apples, ensuring quality and traceability. Rural Development Digital Village Initiative (FAO) : Municipalities like Kalinchowk, Rong, and Chhinnamasta are piloting digital tools, including blockchain-powered systems and IoT-enabled irrigation, to boost agricultural productivity and climate resilience. Education Academic Credential Verification : Blockchain is being explored to issue tamper-proof digital certificates. This would simplify verification for employers and reduce fraud in academic qualifications. These initiatives underscore Nepal’s proactive approach to using blockchain for sustainable development. Challenges to Adoption Despite early progress, several hurdles remain: Digital Infrastructure : Many rural regions lack reliable internet access. Policy & Regulation : Nepal currently has unclear or restrictive policies on cryptocurrency and blockchain-related ventures. Awareness & Expertise : Blockchain is still new to most educators, policymakers, and the public. Addressing these issues is critical for broader implementation. The Synergy of AI and Blockchain Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two of the most transformative technologies of our time. While they come from different roots, blockchain being a decentralized ledger system and AI being a decision-making and data analysis engine, their integration opens up powerful possibilities. Here’s how AI and blockchain complement each other: 1. Transparent Data Source : Blockchain provides clean, traceable data that AI can trust for training and analysis. Every data entry on a blockchain is verifiable, making it a reliable foundation for AI models. 2. Autonomous Systems : Decentralized AI can be built using blockchain. Instead of relying on a single server, AI operations can be distributed across multiple nodes, promoting autonomy and reducing single points of failure. 3. Privacy Protection : Blockchain’s cryptographic foundations protect data privacy during AI training and operations. This makes it safer to work with sensitive data while maintaining model performance. 4. Distributed Computing Power : AI requires vast computing resources. Blockchain helps by pooling distributed systems, reducing hardware costs, and balancing energy loads. 5. Enhanced Security : Smart contracts on blockchains can have vulnerabilities. AI can detect and prevent exploitation by improving the logic and resilience of these contracts. 6. Improved Data Handling : AI improves the efficiency of reading and querying blockchain data. Techniques like the TTA-CB protocol combined with optimization algorithms can make data storage and retrieval faster. 7. Authenticity & Auditability : AI decisions can be hard to explain. Blockchain helps by keeping an immutable log of data, model changes, and decision steps, supporting explainable AI and trust in its outputs. 8. Augmentation : AI adds intelligence to blockchain-based systems. It can process large datasets quickly and offer actionable insights, enabling smart automation and model sharing across networks. 9. Automation : Smart contracts can use AI to make real-time decisions-for example, choosing the most efficient shipping method or resolving disputes automatically. Together, AI and blockchain can create decentralized AI systems that are more transparent, secure, and scalable. From protecting healthcare data to improving logistics and enabling smart governance, their synergy is already shaping the future. Education and Awareness in Nepal Blockchain is still a relatively new concept for many in nepal, but awareness is slowly starting to grow among people. While as I stated at the beginning of this blog that this technology is often misunderstood as just “crypto”. Educational efforts are beginning to clarify its real-world potential. Some institutions like Kathmandu University have started offering introductory sessions and short courses on blockchain. These just cover the basics, how blockchain works, its use cases, adn tools like Ethereum, Solana and smart contracts. However, such programs are still limited and are mostly available in few urban universities There’s currently no dedicated undergraduate or postgraduate programs focused solely on blockchain technology. Most students still learn about it informally, through youtube, online courses or developers forums. Community and Events Nepal’s blockchain ecosystem is rapidly evolving, driven by a collaborative network of organizations and communities dedicated to education, innovation, and secure digital transformation. eSatya eSatya is a leading blockchain initiative in Nepal, dedicated to advancing blockchain education and development. In January 2025, eSatya hosted the “Bringing Devcon to Kathmandu” event, sponsored by Devcon as part of its Satellite Events funding round. The event featured screenings of Ethereum Devcon keynotes and facilitated discussions on Ethereum’s global impact, aiming to inspire local developers and enthusiasts . Additionally, eSatya offers a 12-week Blockchain Fellowship Program, supported by the Ethereum Foundation’s Ecosystem Support Program. This mentor-led course equips participants with practical skills in blockchain development, including smart contract creation and decentralized application (DApp) development. In the 2023 cohort, 17 out of 22 fellows successfully completed the program and presented their projects, such as blockchain-based digital health records and decentralized finance applications. HimalAI HimalAI is an emerging tech community in Nepal that focuses on integrating blockchain with artificial intelligence. In April 2025, HimalAI organized a 48-hour AI/Web3 Hackathon at the HimalAI Hacker House near Tribhuvan University in Kirtipur. The event brought together developers, data scientists, and entrepreneurs to collaborate on innovative solutions leveraging the combined power of AI and blockchain technologies. Participants competed for NPR 100,000 in prizes and engaged in workshops and keynotes covering topics such as AI tools, Web3 applications, data collection, and model fine-tuning . The hackathon aimed to foster a collaborative environment for building real-world solutions and advancing the tech ecosystem in Nepal. Blockchain Foundation Nepal serves as a community-driven platform, bringing together blockchain enthusiasts, developers, and professionals through regular meetups and discussions to explore blockchain-based solutions and foster an active blockchain community in Nepal. CryptoGen Nepal , a cybersecurity firm, plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem by ensuring the security of blockchain applications and infrastructure. Their services include IS audits, vulnerability assessments, and incident response, helping safeguard blockchain platforms against potential threats. Nepal Internet Governance Forum (Nepal IGF) is a multi stakeholder platform that discusses internet governance issues, including the development and regulation of emerging technologies like blockchain. By bringing together government, private sector, civil society, and technical community representatives, Nepal IGF facilitates dialogues that shape the future of internet and blockchain policies in the country. Together, these organizations are cultivating a robust blockchain ecosystem in Nepal, promoting education, innovation, and secure implementation of blockchain technologies across various sectors. Challenges Despite these efforts, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption and understanding onr blockchain in Nepal: Limited Formal Education: Blockchain technology is not yet a standard part of academic curricula in most educational institutions. Misconceptions: There is prevalent confucsion between blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, leading to skepticism and hesitancy in embracing blockchain solutions. Resource constraints: Access to necessary resources, such as computing infrastructures and expert mentorship, is limited, particularly in rural areas Future Opportunities for Nepal Nepal can unlock tremendous value with blockchain in areas like: Voting Systems : Secure, transparent digital voting. Land Registries : Immutable, accessible property records. Disaster Relief : Transparent fund allocation during emergencies. Tourism : Blockchain-based tourist identity and insurance solutions. With proper policy and public-private partnerships, Nepal can become a blockchain innovation hub in South Asia. Conclusion Nepal is not too late to the blockchain revolution in fact, it may be just on time. By embracing this technology strategically, we can foster transparency, fight corruption, and empower citizens from the Himalayas to the Terai. Let us not wait for revolutions to happen. Let us build them, block by block. We are in a time when artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over our world, and its influence on the job market is generally taking a negative turn. You must have heard ominous statements: “AI is taking our jobs,” “Machines are making humans obsolete,” or “Automation means unemployment.” While such headlines are good clickbait material, they miss a fundamental point: AI isn’t so much eliminating jobs as it is transforming them. While it’s true that automation is revolutionizing the workforce, the idea that AI is taking human jobs overlooks a more subtle and hopeful reality. What’s really happening is that work roles are shifting, skills are evolving, and reskilling is the new norm. Instead of worrying about the rise of intelligent machines, we must prepare for a new era-one that appreciates flexibility, lifelong learning, and the unique value only humans can deliver. Let’s discuss AI, automation, and augmentation, and their differences. Understanding the Difference: Automation vs. Augmentation A popular myth is that AI will replace humans entirely. But AI doesn’t necessarily replace people in totality; it replaces tasks. To thoroughly understand the effect of AI on the job market, we need to differentiate between automation and augmentation. Automation implies the complete transfer of tasks from humans to machines. It is most certain to affect work that is repetitive, rule-based, and predictable-dare we say data entry, straightforward accounting, or routine factory work? Augmentation, on the contrary, is the utilization of artificial intelligence to enhance and supplement the capabilities of human workers. Decision-making, creativity, emotional intelligence, or strategic thinking is jobs that are less prone to be replaced and more apt to be augmented by AI. Take the field of medicine, for example. Radiologists are not being replaced by AI-they’re using it to read scans more quickly and accurately. Teachers are not being removed from the classroom-they’re using AI software to personalize lesson plans and cater to different learning styles. In most industries, AI is a collaborator, not an adversary. A widely-quoted McKinsey report estimates 60% of occupations have at least 30% of activities automated, and less than 5% of occupations are completely automated. That means the great majority of people won’t be losing their jobs to AI; rather, their jobs will change. Jobs at Risk, Jobs on the Rise. AI Behind? So, what are the real jobs in risk? It’s not so much jobs as a whole, but tasks within a job. Anything that entails hand-to-keyboard repetitive or mechanical procedures, it data entry clerks, telemarketers, or even parts of customer service-can be threatened by automation. Yet most other jobs are not just safe-they’re growing: AI/ML Engineers Data Scientists Cybersecurity Analysts Cloud Computing Specialists Digital Transformation Officers AI Ethics and Compliance Officers Even traditionally “low-tech” jobs are evolving. Marketing professionals, for example, now need to learn about data analytics. HR personnel are using AI tools for smarter hiring and employee retention strategies. What counts as “technical” is expanding, and hybrid roles that combine human and technical skills are in great demand. The Rise of Reskilling and Lifelong Learning One of the most profound changes AI is bringing to the workplace is the new focus on up-skilling and reskilling. Skills have an ever-shortening half-life. A skill learned five years ago might be obsolete today. The World Economic Forum estimates that 50% of all workers will need reskilling by 2025. How does this work out in practical life? Educational Digital Platforms Large web-based open course platforms like Coursera, DataCamp, edX, and Udemy are thriving. Individuals are gaining certificates in cloud computing, AI development, project management, and data analytics-let alone coding skills-within a few months or weeks. Corporate Reskilling Programs Leading companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM are investing heavily in internal upskilling programs. Amazon, to cite an excellent example, invested more than $700 million in reskilling 100,000 employees in emerging skills like machine learning and cloud computing. Public Sector Initiatives A few governments are also taking early action. Examples are Singapore’s SkillsFuture and Finland’s AI education program for all, which illustrate the role policy can play in enabling citizens to adjust to technological change. The key takeaway? Lifelong learning is no longer a luxury-it’s a necessity. Human Strengths in the Age of AI As computers get better at doing logical and computational tasks, those things that make us uniquely human are all the more valuable. AI can perhaps do complex equations and pattern recognition at scale-but it still cannot replicate emotional intelligence, creativity, critical thinking, and moral discernment. That’s where human beings continue to surpass: Creativity & Innovation: Though AI can produce text, it is impossible to generate ideas of cultural or emotional significance. The nursing care of a nurse who demonstrates empathy or the counseling provided by an exemplary teacher cannot be substituted by any system. Ethical Decision-Making: AI operates within defined parameters; it is not capable of solving ethical problems without human involvement. Contextual Understanding: Humans can comprehend subtleties, humor, sarcasm, and cultural references that machines fail to catch. The future of employment transcends the mere acquisition of coding skills; it encompasses the ability to coexist and collaborate with machines, while simultaneously emphasizing the qualities that render us uniquely human. Adaptability: The Ultimate Career Skill In the AI era, the single most valuable skill is not technical skill-it’s adaptability. The individuals who will thrive will be the ones who can change, learn new tools, and continue to adapt. To present a real-world example, one can look at the revolution taking place in the journalism sector. Initially, there were concerns that artificially generated news stories would displace human reporters. But the reality is far more complex. Journalists are now utilizing AI tools to rapidly produce first drafts, track public opinion, and identify emerging trends. Consequently, this technology enables them to devote more time to investigating journalism and deeper reporting. Similarly, customer service roles are changing. Chatbots handle FAQs, and human reps focus on high-empathy, high-complexity situations. In logistics, warehouse automation is creating roles for robotics supervisors and systems analysts. Goodbye to the ancient adage-specialize in one thing and that’s it for life. The new motto is: “Stay curious, stay flexible, stay learning.” A Global Perspective It’s also important to mention that AI impacts vary by geography. In wealthy nations, the uptake of AI is faster, but so are investments in digital infrastructure and re-skilling. In poorer nations, there’s more likelihood of job displacement without a safety net. Yet, global organizations are now turning their attention to inclusive AI development. The OECD, World Economic Forum, and UNESCO are championing AI policies that leave no one behind-especially women, minority communities, and employees in vulnerable industries. Final Thoughts: It’s Not AI vs. Humans-It’s AI with Humans The fear that artificial intelligence will “take our jobs” ignores the complexity of the changes that are underway. Yes, the character of work is changing, but this change does not mean the elimination of human labor. Rather, we are forced to rethink our identities, form new competencies, and envision a future in which technology enhances our abilities instead of replacing us. Instead of asking, “Will AI replace my job?” a more appropriate question is: How do I implement artificial intelligence to enhance my work performance? The future of work will not be man versus machine-it will be about co-creation, collaboration, and continuous growth. So, who is being replaced, then? Not the people. However, human activities refuse to move forward. Have you ever wondered how Instagram seems to know exactly what reel you’d like next, or how your phone can recognize your face even when you’re smiling? It’s like these things just get you very well and know you so much (are our data being leaked....😅). Well, the secret to that magic is something that we call machine learning. It’s a technology sneaking its way into almost all aspects of our lives without us even realizing it. From the suggestions we get on social media to how doctors diagnose disease, machine learning is making the world around us work its magic. But what the question is, how does it do that, and where else is it being used? Let me help you break it down simply. What is Machine Learning? At its core, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn. Using ML, your PC can learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task, from math to reasoning and identifying objects. Instead of telling specific instructions to your computer to follow, like running a Python script to find a derivative of a number, we provide it with examples and let it figure it out by itself without us telling it. Additionally, the machine will learn based on the patterns it detects and understand itself based on what pattern it represents. Let’s think of it this way: rather than telling a computer step-by-step how to find a cat in a photo, we show it thousands of cat pictures and let it discover the visual patterns that make a cat a cat like its ears, whiskers, tail, and pointy ears. The machine will not be able to identify it in one shot, but as we show it thousands of photos of cats continuously, over time, the machine will start to learn the common patterns in the photo and can pick out a cat in a new photo based on the pattern it learned. How is Machine Learning Different from Traditional Programming? Traditional programming follows a straightforward approach: Input + Rules → Output Machine learning flips this process: Input + Output → Rules We give the system inputs (data) and desired outputs, and it learns the rules to transform one into the other. This is powerful because it means the computer can handle tasks that would be impossibly complex to code explicitly. Types of Machine Learning There are three main types: 1. Supervised Learning In supervised learning, we provide examples that are labeled. The machine learns to associate some inputs with some outputs. For example, to develop a spam filter, we might input an algorithm with hundreds of emails that are classified as “spam” or “not spam.” The algorithm learns about the features that distinguish spam mail from good mail. 2. Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning occurs when a model is trained on data without labels. The algorithm tries to learn the patterns or clusters within the data itself. Unsupervised learning can be employed by a retailer who wants to group customers into different categories based on what they buy without knowing beforehand what these groups will be. 3. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is a method whereby an agent is trained to make decisions based on the feedback provided by the environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for actions and learns to maximize rewards with time. This is how AlphaGo was instructed to play the board game of Go at the superhuman level, and robots learn to travel through intricate spaces. This is the reason why beating a chess bot is so hard, as it was trained under reinforcement learning. The Machine Learning Process A typical machine learning project follows these steps: Collect Data: Gather relevant data for your problem. Prepare Data: Clean and format the data so it’s usable. Choose a model: Select an appropriate algorithm for your task. Train the Model: Feed your data to the algorithm so it can learn patterns. Evaluate the Model: Test how well your model performs. Tune Parameters: Adjust settings so that they can improve performance. Make Predictions: Use your trained model on new data. Real-World Applications Machine learning powers many technologies we use daily: Virtual Assistants: Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use machine learning to understand and respond to voice commands. Recommendation Systems: Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon suggest content based on your preferences. Email Filtering: Gmail automatically sorts emails into primary, social, and promotional categories. Medical Diagnosis: Algorithms help doctors detect diseases from medical images. Fraud Detection: Banks use machine learning to identify suspicious transactions. Challenges in Machine Learning Despite its power, machine learning faces several challenges: Data Quality: Models are only as good as the data they’re trained on. Bias: If training data contains biases, the model will likely perpetuate them. Explainability: Complex models often function as “black boxes,” making it difficult to understand how they reach specific conclusions. Privacy Concerns: often requires large amounts of data, raising questions about data privacy. Getting Started with Machine Learning So now, if you’re interested in learning more about machine learning, here are some steps to get started: Learn the Basics: Understand fundamental concepts like algorithms, models, and evaluation metrics like how will your machine learn an image or predict, learn what models are there to train a machine learning model, and how to know if your machine is learning instead of mugging up everything. Study Statistics and Probability: These are the mathematical foundations of machine learning. Yup, math is needed to understand the algorithm I said too, so yes it is very important and we cannot skip this. Pick a Programming Language: Python is the most popular choice for machine learning due to its simplicity and robust libraries. Try Simple Projects: Start with beginner-friendly problems like predicting house prices or classifying images. You can use Kaggle to learn and do projects. Conclusion Machine learning is redefining how we solve issues in industries. By allowing computers to learn from data, we can solve complex problems that would be impossible with traditional programming techniques. The field is developing extremely rapidly, with new methods and applications consistently being discovered. If you’d like to integrate machine learning into your business or are considering doing so as a career, gaining an understanding of the fundamentals is the first step toward tapping its potential. As we advance into the future, machine learning will forever change our world in many exciting ways, making now a great time to dive into this cutting-edge technology.

Introduction: In the world of computers and the internet, most people compete with Mac and Windows, just like comparing iOS and Android not knowing there is something known as Linux. If you are a tech student or one into computers, you might have heard about Linux somewhere. If you’re new to Linux and want to understand why it’s gaining popularity, then this guide, “Linux for Beginners” is for you. Linux is a powerful, secure, and open-source operating system that has become a viable alternative to Windows and macOS. Whether you’re a student, developer, or casual user, Linux offers flexibility and customization to suit your needs. But where have you used it is the question. Those who have not used Linux or maybe have heard it for the first time should know why it is one of the greatest fields to explore. And if you think that it has a great field then why is it not being known as an alternative to Windows and ios, well in reality Linux is used more than these actually, the majority of the world’s cloud computing servers are Linux based. It is a dominating OS for web servers, database servers, and other applications that power the majority of internet services. It is also used in embedded systems like smartwatches, Bluetooth speakers, thermostats cars, and many more. The Android that the majority of you talk about is based on Linux itself, not just that more than 500 computers are using Linux as their operating system, and hackers or expert programmers prefer Linux compared to other OS. So the question arises should we switch to Linux? Should we switch to Linux? We just talked about Linux being used by hackers and developers, not just that I also told you guys about Linux being used in the supercomputer so it means Linux is really fast and cool right? Well not exactly. The majority of Linux is perceived faster because there is no such bloatware like Windows and is lightweight compared to MacOS, so the majority of tasks might feel better in performance compared to other OS but this will depend on your system. I told you about the system cause Linux runs on almost anything and I mean it. Let me tell you more about its advantages. Reasons to Choose Linux Security and Privacy Unlike Mac and Windows, Linux is far secure with strong security features such as no such things as forced updates which are the most irritating things in the majority of OS, and no bloatware and spyware. Unlike other OS, Linux does not track its users and try to fetch their user data, Linux instead provides you full control over the system and lets you decide what to do. One fun thing about is that the majority of viruses in the world are designed for either Windows or MacOS so by default there are very less viruses ever designed that work on Linux making it more secure Open Source and Free: I just told you about how Linux gives us whole control and is transparent to us and this is what developers love about it and thus call it Open source as we can get to know how it was made and how to configure it all on the internet and all for free. So instead of paying for licenses for OS like Windows and macOS, we can just get Linux for free. Just being free makes this a great choice for students and budget-conscious users Performance and Efficiency I talked about hardware to you and why I brought it was because Linux can run on almost all hardware, Linux is lightweight and optimized for performance making it a great choice to revive your old laptop that becomes buggy and slow due to Windows. Just install Linux and feel it as if it’s new. Things to remember before Downloading Linux as a beginner to Linux Hardware Compatibility: Personally, when I downloaded Linux on old hardware there were no such issues like this but when I switched to new-gen laptops a lot of problems arose such as hardware not supporting, divrives not responding and the keyboard not functioning. These are common in Linux as the Linux you download is not fully built according to your laptop but in general consideration of what a simple device looks, so as you get more new gen computer you need to switch to better Linux or download all the hardware and drivers to the current Linux which might be quite hard for new users. Software compatibility: Not just hardware and drivers, so many software are not compatible with Linux too for instance majority of editing software like MS Office, Adobe Platform, and more are not available in Linux normally, we need to hardcode and download them from a third, and still it may not support fully. While Linux does provide you alternatives to this application they may not be that good as you are familiar with the original ones in Windows and MacOS Gaming While Linux gaming has come a long way, many major games still don’t support Linux natively, and you may need Wine or Proton (via Steam) to run Windows-based games, which isn’t always perfect and can require extra configuration. Learning Curve Linux has a steeper learning curve, especially if you’re used to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Windows or macOS. The majority of you have not used a terminal at all and the majority have a GUI for everything so switching from that is hard. You might have to use the terminal (command line) for certain tasks, and troubleshooting often requires technical knowledge. It requires more and more manual setup which might be hard for first-time users. A Ray of Hope For the Passionate Ones With so harsh truth about Linux majority of people have already given up using Linux, but is it bad? Can we use Linux despite these hurdles? Absolutely. And today, we’re here to shine a light on why Linux is still worth it. It may not be a smooth ride but a ride you will always cherish.

Blogs As we are getting more technology exposure here in Nepal, a lot of new methods and changes have been seen in multiple. But not quite much in the banking sector. As smartphones are now available almost all over the country, it is no surprise that Artificial Intelligence is also starting to pop here. However, like technology, Nepal’s banking sector has been slower compared to other sectors. Banks in Nepal, while modernizing and adopting new techniques, are still hesitant to fully accept AI. This is mainly due to the terms of infrastructure regulation, and trust. But as Nepal’s financial services sector continues to evolve, AI offers multiple services: personalized services and many more. It also offers smarter risk management and more secure transaction processes. So let’s see and explore why the banking sector is slow in this trend. Similarly, let’s explore what opportunity this technology holds, and how we can benefit from this system. The Challenge of AI Adoption in Nepal’s Banking Sector Regulatory and Compliance Concerns Nepal’s banking system operates under a strict regulatory framework. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank of Nepal, closely monitors financial institutions. Additionally, it ensures the safety and security of customer deposits and financial systems. While there are regulations regarding AI being adopted globally at a slow pace, Nepal’s banking sector is particularly cautious. This is due to the lack of clear guidelines on how to implement AI technologies within the confines of its regulatory environment. For instance, the NRB’s existing regulation, which focuses mainly on traditional banking methods, might not fully be compatible with the data-driven nature of AI. With AI systems relying heavily on data, including sensitive customer information, its compliance with NEpal’s privacy act and others becomes even more complex. Therefore there is a rooted hesitation in implementing AI solutions as the main concern is data security and regulatory oversight. 1. Data Security and Privacy As said, Data Security remains a concerning topic and a top priority for Banks. As AI requires large datasets to function effectively, the risk of security breaches and data misuse is a growing concern. It is also to be noted that Nepal’s Banking system is often targeted by cybercriminals and this kind of news on people’s data being breached or leaked is common. To reduce this an AI should have a secure system to mitigate threats like fraud, hacking, and identity theft. In Nepal where the digital payment system is just a new innovative step compared to other countries who have already introduced this system years ago and yet still begot one or two problems in the well-established payment system we use today. Now, introducing AI to this field and trusting that AI’s ability to keep personal and financial data is very hard. To do this we will require time and a lot of data to train the model. Additionally meeting the demand of both customers and regulators in the process is also important. 2. Infrastructure and Legacy Systems Many banks in Nepal still operate on legacy traditional systems. The systems are not designed to integrate with the advanced features of AI. Unlike other countries where banks have new cutting-edge technology, Nepali financial institutions often operate on older core banking systems. The cost and risk of upgrading this system can be problematic, especially for smaller or regional banks. Additionally, the high quantity data for training ML models, is a hectic process here as majority of data collection , storage and sharing are oftenfragmented which creates another roadblock for Ai-driven solution. As a result, banks are very serious and cautious in the approach of Ai integration and monthly reluctant to overhaul the existing system that they are comfortable with. 3. Skill Gap AI itself is a new concept introduced in Nepal. The skills required to develop and manage AI are thus limited here. While there has been growth in the tech industry, the specialized knowledge needed to operate AI-driven tools. But in the banking sector or any other sector, such tools are quite limited. Data Scientists, machine learning engineers, and Ai specialists are in high demand globally, and Nepal’s banking sector faces the same shortage of talents. The Opportunities of AI in Nepal’s Banking Sector Despite these challenges, the potential for Ai in Nepal’s banking sector is huge, and here is how Ai can make a difference: 1. Personalized Banking Services The Nepalese banking sector focuses on customer service enhancement as mobile banking services expand their reach to residents of urban and rural Nepal. The implementation of AI enables Nepali banks to deliver customized products that specifically address the personal requirements of their individual customers. AI-powered chatbots provide round-the-clock customer support facilities that handle inquiries and transactions alongside personalized financial recommendations based on user spending behavior. The increase in Nepali consumers choosing mobile and digital banking platforms will drive escalated requirements for personalized banking services across the industry. AI systems examine financial records in combination with payment behaviors and societal indicators to customize financial services that let users improve their money management strategies. 2. Fraud Detection and Prevention The growth of digital banking across Nepal has produced intensified banking fraud cases affecting the industry. Artificial intelligence functions as a reliable instrument to both find and halt fraudulent behavior. AI leverages real-time transaction analysis through machine learning algorithms to spot unexpected spending activities which then allows it to notify bank customers or the institution before major financial losses occur. AI technology assists Nepali banks to discover credit card abuse together with money laundering and identity theft leading to enhanced cybersecurity protection. The implementation of AI would deliver necessary security measures when Nepali banks plan to expand their digital services. 3. Operational Efficiency Bank institutions throughout Nepal together with international financial institutions seek continuous methods to minimize operational costs and enhance operational efficiency. The implementation of AI solutions enables banks to execute repetitive duties like data recording together with loan analysis while running credit ratings besides checking against industry regulations. The implementation of AI leads banks to achieve better operational efficiency with reduced costs. The Nepalese banking system which maintains mostly manual and paper-intensive services can experience rapid progress thanks to AI applications. Benefits from this approach would improve the customer journey while simultaneously lowering both operational expenses and human-related service shortcomings. Conclusion The banking sector in Nepal is approaching an era of artificial intelligence transformation. The banking sector of Nepal faces ongoing challenges linked to regulatory checkpoints and limited infrastructure. In addition to the shortage of capable personnel but the promise of AI to enhance customer service and operations exists in direct proportion to its capacity to boost security measures. Future improvements in Nepal’s digital environment will make artificial intelligence essential for banking organizations. It will make us want to stay competitive while serving customers who use technology. The banking sector in Nepal will adapt AI capabilities at a moderate pace given that future prospects appear positive. If Nepal’s financial institutions establish plans, gain regulatory certainty and prioritize data security then they can use AI to develop an efficient banking system that is centered on customer needs and secured operations. Introduction Optical character recognition is the key to document process automation in today’s digital world, as it allows machines to read printed and handwritten texts. Although OCR has made significant progress in some major languages such as English, Chinese, and Spanish, it remains a great challenge to low-resource languages, which do not have a digital dataset of their own and NLP resources. This article will discover how recent AI and deep learning advancements are revolutionizing low-resource language OCR for low-resource languages. Its implementation in low-resource languages has remained only a dream until the recent advancement and breakthrough in AI and deep learning. This is going to bring a new possibility for OCR with low-resource languages, which may revolutionize the sectors of government documentation, historical text digitization, and financial automation in regions of these languages, and hence large-prevailing areas, among others. He then proceeds to explain the challenges of OCR in low-resource languages, elaborating on the very recent advancement in AI-driven OCR and how it is impacting automation across different industries. Understanding Low-Resource Languages in OCR What Are Low-Resource Languages? Low-resourced languages are those languages that normally lack large-scale annotated data, clean and robust linguistic resources (such as dictionaries and corpora), labeled training data, and, more than anything, powerful and well-supported research in computational linguistics. Some of the most famous examples are Nepali, Sinhala, and Amharic; in general, local, indigenous languages that do not have large communities developed around them. While languages such as English or Chinese have billions of texts available in digital form, such languages often suffer from a lack of labeled text data to train an OCR system. OCR and Its Role in Automation OCR is the technology to convert the hard-copy or scanned text into a machine-readable format. It’s applied in wide areas such as: Document digitization (scanning books, archives, historical records) Automated processing of invoices and receipts (financial automation) Automatic data entry in government and enterprise workflows Assistive support technologies like reading tools for the visually impaired OCR systems include Google Tesseract for high-resource languages, ABBYY FineReader, Amazon Textract, and several others. OCR systems like Google Tesseract work very well for high-resource languages. Still, for low-resource languages, the efficiency of the tools described above depends primarily on the data available and is therefore often associated with low accuracy because there is a scarcity of this data, combined with complex scripts and various handwriting styles. Challenges in OCR for Low-Resource Languages Lack of High-Quality Training Data OCR models inherently require thousands to millions of labeled text image pairs for effective training. In most low-resource languages, there is already a lack of digitized books, newspapers, etc., which further hampers training a good OCR model. Texts from books and newspapers available in low-resource languages are mostly turn of the century with highly deteriorated quality. It is, therefore, a big problem for the straightening and orderly OCR training model. Complex and Unique Scripts Written low-resource languages are generally non-Latin scripts, which pose a big challenge to any OCR engine. This might be associated with: Devanagari script (used in Nepali, Hindi, and Marathi) with character formations that are very tough Ethiopic script found in Amharic, which has many unique glyphs Also, Brahmic scripts are associated with ligatures and stacked letters. The traditional OCR models fail to yield good results on these scripts, especially when it comes to recognizing handwritten text. Poorly Scanned, Noisy Data Most of the documents written in low-resource languages have been scanned from deteriorated, old, and dirty sources and could have ink smudges, faded text, torn pages, or mixed text of different languages within the same document. Some of them may not have uniform font or space, which will make the OCR system much less accurate compared to those in high-resource languages. Lack of NLP Support for Post-Processing OCR is sometimes dependent on the NLP models, which help in better output correction for spell and grammar checking, etc. Since low-resourced languages suffer from the problem of missing pre-trained NLP models, OCR systems often fail to correct errors in the extracted text effectively. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning: The New Wave in OCR Automation The use of deep learning research in OCR models supported by artificial intelligence has been engaged in automating text extraction in under-resourced languages. This is one of the main methods they achieve this. Self-Supervised and Few-Shot Learning Instead of having to depend on huge labeled datasets, the AI models are now learning by being: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-The models learn from unlabelled data in large corpora at the input level like raw text or images. Few-Shot Learning-is to learn patterns based on very small data points, of course, instrumental for rare languages, an example of it being Facebook’s SeamlessM4T model using self-supervised learning to enhance multilingual text recognition - even in languages with less data. Advanced techniques - Transformer-Based OCR Models In the earlier days, OCRs used to be either rule-based or statistical. The modern OCR engines now have transformer models like Tesseract 5.0, TrOCR (pre-trains on high-resource languages and fine-tunes for low-resource languages) from Microsoft, and PaddleOCR (allows users to train custom models for rare scripts). Data Augmentation Techniques Some data augmentation strategies applied by the researchers due to limited labeled datasets include: GANs for generating synthetic data of text images in low-resource languages Rotating, distorting, or blurring text images in the training data to enhance the robustness of OCR. Example: Working on the Sanskrit OCR Project at Google involved extensive work to fix character recognition in ancient manuscripts, for which synthetic text generation had to be used. Cloud OCR Approaches and Edge OCR Enterprises are implementing OCR engines with cloud and mobile edge-computing solutions to enable more universally accessible OCR. Cloud-based OCR services-Google Vision API, and Microsoft Azure OCR-have added support for more low-resource languages. Edge computing enables OCR models on low-power devices, such as smartphones, to automate at scale Ways to Automate OCR in Low-Resource Languages Since AI-OCR is getting strengthened, there are a few significant ways in which OCR can drive automation: In the Federal and Public Administration: Decision-making statement automation for the process of paper-based documents for office work Birth certificates, records of land, and legal forms got scanned to keep in digital format Facilitated automatic document verification to assess citizens in remote areas. In Finance and Banking OCR can process invoices in cheques and in any local language. Digitization of receipts and tax documents for small businesses Preservation of Historical and Cultural OCR proves helpful for scanning old manuscripts and digitizing them; therefore, they can be preserved. OCR helps preserve old texts and manuscripts by conversion to a digital format, thus preserving endangered languages and cultures. AI Assistants and Chatbots OCR can extract the content of documents to power assistant-driven AI. Translate handwritten content into any language The Future of OCR in Low-Resource Languages It has been noted that AI and deep learning have opened up new possibilities for OCR in low-resource languages where automation was not so easy. While the challenges stay-limited datasets, script complexity, and noisy input-new techniques are coming up to improve the accuracy of the procedure. As OCR for low-resource languages gets more reliable, this will allow for the automation of government services, financial processing, cultural preservation, and educational fields. It is this technology that is going to bridge the digital gap by relaying all languages, no matter how rare they are, into beneficiaries of the power of AI-driven automation. This technology is going to be the start of a brand new future where all languages, no matter how rare, are going to benefit from the power of AI-driven automation. The future of OCR is not only with reading text but with digitalizing every language. At the moment cyber-attacks along with data breaches are growing more and more sophisticated by the day. The search for new ways of protecting our very own personal data has never been more critical. Cue biometric authentication new technology is a game-changer in the cyber security field. Spanning from fingerprinting to face scanning and iris scanning, biometric security solutions present a more secure and more convenient alternative. It is replacing and working as an alternative of passwords and PINs. However, as with any emerging tech, the use of biometrics raises serious privacy issues. Additionally, it also raised ethical questions regarding the overall use of biometrics. The Era of Biometric Security (Biometric Authentication) Biometrics is the act of recording our unique physical characteristics. Additionally, it might be a fingerprint, the contours of our face. It also may be the hue of the iris, for instance, we can use it as a form of identification. It is pilfered or lost. Biometrics is an authentication that physically ties to the biology of a human person. Biometric authentication is hard to duplicate. Facial recognition has been so popular because it is easy to use and easy to implement on daily devices. Phones, laptops, and even residential security systems use facial recognition to provide access. Today, it is also an easy and convenient method for consumers to unlock devices. Similarly, fingerprint readers, now ubiquitous on smartphones, are integrated into larger platforms. This will offer a secure and convenient method of verification. Similarly, for even more forward thinkers, there is iris scan technology. The technology provides yet another layer of security, imaging the patterns unique to the eye’s iris to verify identities. These technologies are widely viewed as a possible answer to the long-standing issue of password management. As cyber-attacks become more advanced password files get compromised daily. This leads users to find it difficult to practice good security hygiene. With biometrics, users should not remember complex combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols-they only need to be themselves. The Promise of Biometrics for Online Security The biggest advantage of biometric authentication is being able to create an even higher level of security. Passwords are either weak, used on more than one website, or just plain guessed easily. People use simple phrases or information easily found on the web. Biometrics are much more difficult to replicate. Even if the hacker manages to get your password or PIN, they would require your unique biological characteristics to breach the system. Furthermore, biometric systems are fast and convenient. Opening one’s phone with a quick scan of the individual’s fingerprint or glancing at one’s phone for facial scanning is normal. This kind of convenience can come with the ability to remove a significant amount of friction from users, allowing them to safely log in to online services without having to recall passwords or undergo multiple-step authentication processes. Furthermore, biometric systems can be multi-factor in nature. For instance, a device can require both a fingerprint and a face scan, which adds a layer of protection that isn’t possible with passwords. Since online threats are not demonstrating any indication of decelerating, layered security in the form of biometrics could prove to be one of the most robust protections on hand to combat cybercrime. Privacy Concerns: The Dark Side of Biometric Data For all their potential benefits, biometric systems aren’t without some very legitimate concerns of all of which are those having to do with privacy. Biometric authentication captures and stores a person’s own biological data by its very nature. Unlike a password, which we can change if someone compromises it, we cannot change our fingerprint, face, or iris. Because they are fixed and permanent. If hackers steal or someone mismanages that data, the consequences can be much worse One of the greatest risks is centralized biometric storage. When we login with biometrics, the information is kept on a server or in the cloud. When these databases are compromised by the attackers, they will not just obtain usernames and passwords but also very personal and irreversible data. Unwanted access to this kind of sensitive data could lead to identity theft, fraud, or blackmail. Another concern is the use of surveillance. Facial recognition software has been specifically aimed at application in public areas where people are unaware of being photographed. Governments and non-governmental agencies are using the systems to monitor individuals’ movements, activities, and even political affiliations. Though proponents have argued that it can be used in ways that might make us safer (e.g., to arrest criminals or deter terrorist attacks), others view it as an insidious threat to privacy and a tool for totalitarian oppression. In addition, their accuracy is an issue as well. They can have false positives and false negatives, thus giving unauthorized individuals access or not giving authorized individuals access. The study has determined that facial recognition software, for instance, has been found to operate at a higher rate of errors in identifying females and minorities, bringing about issues regarding the fairness and reliability of these technologies. Balancing Security and Privacy As with any technology progress, the issue with turning biometric authentication into a success is achieving the correct balance between security and privacy. To prevent such systems from being an evil empire, there must be strict regulation and protection mechanisms. Biometric information is encrypted and protected, and people should be in a position to delete or revoke access to their information at their discretion. Transparency about collection and usage of the biometric information will be most important to win consumers’ trust. The second important step is to design biometric systems that are equitable. The developers need to remove biases in facial recognition and other biometric systems so that they function as equally effectively with all populations of people. This will prevent discrimination. similarly, it also makes the population discriminatorily untargeted or excluded by the system. Last, users must be cognizant and careful of the technologies used. With any authentication method, it is intelligent to be knowledgeable of the risks and take measures to protect personal data. Whether activating multi-factor authentication, using encrypted apps, or selecting services with better privacy settings, users have to do something when it pertains to their cyber security. Conclusion: The Future of Biometric Authentication Biometric authentication is quite possibly the key to the cyber security revolution, with newer, quicker, safer methods of access to our data. Going forward, as technology will undoubtedly continue to improve, even new methods of authentication will emerge, such as voice or even DNA scanning. With all of the innovation, however, we need to be careful not to miss the privacy risk. Finally, the future of biometric security will be in our own hands, as we decide to balance the delicate trade-off between convenience, security, and privacy. With regulatory control, ethical innovation, and transparency as a priority, biometric authentication could well be the answer to a safer online existence. But with every innovation, we must move cautiously lest we mortgage privacy on the altar of convenience in a way we would later regret. Over the past ten years, Rust grew from an experimental project to one of the globe’s best-loved programming languages. Stack Overflow polls have demonstrated its popularity among programmers every year. It has consistently ranked as the ‘most loved’ language for several consecutive years. But are programmers truly so in love with this language? Why do engineers-from amateurs to industrial-scale professionals-keep choosing this language? Especially when so many others are competing in the same space?Today’s blog will delve into what makes this language so popular, its standout features, and how it has been able to etch itself a distinctive niche in contemporary software development. A Brief History Rust was a side project from Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare in 2006. A developer started Rust as a side project, and Mozilla gained enough interest in it to formally sponsor it The goal was to create a language that was highly performing with high safety guarantees, especially in regard to memory safety. After years of development, developers finally launched Rust 1.0 in 2015. Since then, various companies and communities have used it to achieve reliability without sacrificing speed. Why Developers are Loving It 1. Memory Safety Without a Garbage Collector One of the main attractions of Rust is that it has built a novel and fresh method for addressing memory. Whereas with C and C++ the memory is assigned and reclaimed manually by the developer, or in Java and Python it relies on garbage collection, Rust makes use of the model of ownership. With this system, memory is both effectively and safely managed at compile time, removing classes of typical bugs like null pointer dereferences, use-after-free, and data races. By enforcing borrowing and ownership rules strictly, Rust eliminates an entire class of bugs that are notoriously difficult to debug in other languages. That means fewer segmentation faults and no time wasted hunting for memory leaks. 2. Performance Comparable to C and C++ Rust is a compiled language that produces very optimized machine code and is near to C and C++ performance. As speedy as it is, it’s a top contender for system programming, game development, and other performance-critical applications. In contrast to garbage collection-halting languages, Rust provides deterministic runtime behavior and is therefore an ideal candidate for latency-critical applications. 3. Fearless Concurrency Concurrency is likely the most challenging area of contemporary software development. Rust’s ownership model extends to concurrency programming, where data races are detected at compile-time instead of leading to undefined behavior at runtime. The language enables one to use high-level abstractions like threads, async programming, and message-passing concurrency safely. 4. Developer-Friendly Tooling Rust’s ecosystem has a wealth of top-quality tools to enhance development. Cargo: Rust’s build system and dependency manager enable simple dependency management and compilation. Clippy: A built-in linting feature that catches common errors. Rustfmt: Helps enforce consistent code appearance across teams. Documentation Generation: Rust’s built-in documentation system makes it easy to generate well-structured docs directly from code comments. These tools assist in giving a more complete developer experience, so Rust is not just able but also enjoyable to work with. 5. Strong and Supportive Community The Rust community is famous for being friendly and helpful. The official Rust forums, Discord channels, and Reddit discussions are occupied by programmers who willingly share their knowledge. The programming language also enjoys a strong mentorship program and well-written documentation, making it easier to learn for newcomers. A Language Designed for Modern Development Rust was created with issues of modern software development in mind. Whether web assembly, embedded systems, or cloud-native applications, Rust has facets that appeal well to the demands of the day. With corporations such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google researching Rust for some of their projects, it’s clear that language will be part of future software development. Where It Is Being Used Web Development While Rust is not a traditional web development language, libraries like Rocket and Actix-web allow developers to build high-performance, secure web applications. Rust’s performance and safety make it an excellent backend language, especially when handling high-concurrency workloads. Embedded Systems Because of its low-level control and safety guarantees, Rust is becoming a popular choice for embedded programming. Companies working on firmware, IoT, and real-time operating systems are adopting Rust for its reliability and performance. Game Development Programmers need a language that combines speed with security. Rust offers both of them, along with libraries like Bevy and Amethyst that provide game development functionality similar to Unity or Unreal Engine. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Rust has been adopted by the likes of Solana and Polkadot because it is safe, fast, and can handle difficult concurrent operations. The correctness focus that the language is designed on also renders it a suitable choice for blockchain development whose security is of paramount importance. Operating Systems and Systems Programming Rust is also gaining popularity in systems programming. There even exist full-fledged operating systems written in Rust, such as the Redox OS. Microsoft even went far enough to experiment with re-compiling some elements of Windows with Rust for reasons of security and stability. Challenges of Learning Rust Despite its advantages, Rust is not without a learning curve. Developers who come from languages like Python or JavaScript do indeed struggle with Rust’s strict compiler rules and ownership model at first. Yet, once mastered, developers appreciate the power these give to code quality and security. Another difficulty is that Rust’s ecosystem while growing, is not yet as mature as more established languages such as Python or Java. Some libraries may not have the same level of documentation or support, but this is rapidly evolving as the language is used by more individuals. Is Rust the Future of Programming? Rust’s continuing development and adoption across use cases in various industries shows that Rust will reign over programming in the coming years. Its prowess at delivering safety without infringing on performance presents Rust as an excellent opportunity as a current form of software programming. As more companies tap into the positive aspect of applying Rust, the greater the chances are that future years will hold more extensive uses of it. If you’re a programmer looking to increase the value of your skills and safeguard your future career, studying Rust can be one of the best things you can do. Whether you’re building web apps, embedded systems, or high-performance software, Rust offers a mix of safety, performance, and programmer-centric features that few languages can equal. Final Thoughts Rust has turned into a force of revolution in the programming world. With its performance-focused and safe nature, supported by an open and growing community, it is a language with gigantic potential. Its rather steep learning curve aside, its long-term benefit in terms of code stability, concurrency safety, and system performance is gigantic. As companies continue to look out for solutions that are both scalable and secure, Rust’s value is going to grow steadily. Overall, Rust is not just a trend but also shows a larger shift towards the way applications are built nowadays. Its philosophy and its elements match quite well with the changing business and developer priorities, and as such, it is something that has to be seriously considered in the coming years. You recently started your AI journey and keep hearing terms like embeddings and encoding. These concepts are way more critical than you think. For instance, do you know LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek play with embeddings to understand your prompts? The ability to understand prompts dramatically depends on the quality of embeddings. Let’s explore why. In this article we will discuss about Embeddings and Embedding. What are Embeddings? In simple terms, embeddings are vector representations in a vector space. Embeddings are not limited to words, they can be of other inputs like sentences, images, and graphs. Embeddings represent high-dimensional data like texts and images into vectors of low dimension. With this, the task of processing this complex data becomes easier for models that only understand continuous numbers. Vectors are the key here. In computer science, vectors are represented in an array where [a] is a 1-dimensional vector, [a, b] is 2-dimensional, and so on. From a mathematical view, vectors can be added, which applies to embeddings too. Just like adding vectors gives us other vectors, adding embeddings will provide another embedding. Types of Embeddings: Word Embeddings: Word embeddings are vector representations of words in a vector space where each words are given a vector. In the vector space, related words are close to each other. Let’s say if “man” is represented with [0.5, 5.5, -0.7]. Since man and woman are semantically similar words, “woman” would have a vector embedding similar to it. Also, hereby performing arithmetic operations on such vectors, we can attain similar vectors. E.g “king” - “man” + “woman” = “queen”. Some popular models for word embeddings are Word2vec, GloVe, and FastText. Sentence Embeddings: Sentence embeddings are vector representations of whole sentences. Unlike word embeddings, the whole sentence is mapped in a vector space, and semantically similar sentences are closer in the vector space. Models like InferSent, and Doc2vec(extension of Word2vec) are used to generate sentence embeddings. Image Embeddings: Images can also be transformed into vectors, that is exactly what you’ll call image embeddings. CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are best for generating image embeddings, which are later used for tasks like image classification and image retrieval. Audio and speech Embeddings: Audio and speech embeddings are generated by converting the raw audio and speech data into vectors that can be suitable for tasks like speech recognition and emotion detection. VGGish and Wav2vect are models dedicated to such embeddings. Why do we need Embeddings? The problem with raw, categorical, or high-dimensional data Before embeddings were ubiquitous, encoding techniques like one-hot encoding were used to represent categorical variables. However, this technique has limitations. Let’s say we have a small vocabulary of 5 words: “ Cat “, “ dog “, “ fish “, “ bird “, “ horse “ One-hot encoding works by generating a binary representation for each class where the position corresponding to the word is represented by 1. So we get a representation similar to the table below. Such representations are called sparse vectors, and these were the foundations for early word embedding techniques. So this works fine for a small number of classes, but what if we have all the words in the English language? How big will this table be? So big that the computation will be too high and messy. Not only that, while extracting the semantics out of words, the model will be confused. This problem is solved by embeddings, which are also called dense vectors. The embeddings not only numerically represent but are also able to capture the semantics of words by introducing a distance concept where words with similar semantics have a very small distance. For similarity measurements, cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and several others can be used. Real World Applications Embeddings have become foundational across NLP, recommendation systems, and computer vision. Their power lies in transforming raw, high-dimensional data into dense vectors that encode contextual, semantic, or behavioral relationships, enabling machines to reason more effectively about language, users, and visual content. Text Search: Embeddings are key for any retrieval tasks that involve retrieving similar documents based on a given query. Embeddings and embedding models are a crucial part of the RAG( Retrieval Augmented Generation) architecture, which is a great approach to prevent LLMs from hallucination. Recommendation system: In a recommendation system, whether it’s for movies, food, or clothes, embedding models are used to represent them in vectors. They are stored in a vector space and can be compared to recommend similar ones. Sentiment Analysis: Sentiments are very abstract for models to detect, but using embeddings and capturing sentiment-related features can ease the process. Positive words or sentences have similar embeddings, which can differentiate them from negative word embeddings. Evolution of Embedding Models From one-hot to word2vec: One-hot encoding was the most primitive way of representing words in a vector, where only the corresponding word was represented as one and others as zeros. This approach was succeeded by TF-IDF (Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency) in an attempt to capture the importance of words based on their frequency in a document(sentences or phrases) and across all the documents. Sparck Jones proposed it in his paper “A Statistical Interpretation of term specificity and its application in retrieval.” TF-IDF captured more useful information than one-hot encoding, but still could not capture the semantics. Word2vec was a revolutionary technique first proposed in a paper titled “Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space”. It was suggested by Tomas Mikolov and colleagues at Google and published in 2013. Similalry, it uses a shallow neural network to capture the linguistic context of words from a large corpus of text. It produces an embedding that maps words to a vector space, typically of a few hundred dimensions. Cosine Similarity is used to measure the similarity between the embeddings. Static Vs Contextual Embedding Models Models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText are effective at generating dense vector representations of words, known as embeddings, which capture semantic relationships. Word2Vec, in particular, learns these embeddings using one of two architectures: CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) or Skip-gram. However, the embeddings produced by these models are static, meaning each word has a single representation regardless of context. As a result, they struggle with polysemy-where a word has multiple meanings. For example, they cannot distinguish between the word bat in the sentences: “He bought a new bat to play cricket.” “Bat flies at night.” Contextual nuances are lost because the embedding is based solely on word co-occurrence statistics in a fixed window of text, rather than the full context of a sentence. In such scenarios, a contextualized model like BERT( Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) excels where word embeddings are generated based on the context of surrounding words. BERT’s bidirectionality allows it to look for context at both the left and right context of a word during training. So, the embeddings BERT produces are contextual, that is, words can have different embeddings based on their context. This makes it very powerful in generating robust embeddings that can retain contextualized semantics. Key Challenges and Limitations Embedding models is a game-changing concept, but it has ethical considerations. The models may learn the bias in the training data that can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in their applications. So, realizing and mitigating such bias becomes a crucial part of developing a safe and ethical AI system. Bias in Embeddings: Textual data that human produces are inherently biased. So, while training embedding models to learn the semantics and contexts, such bias gets slipped. A common example is associating “doctors” with males and “nurses” with females, reflecting societal stereotypes. These biases can lead to unfairness and discrimination in real-world applications like a recommendation system or a hiring system. To mitigate such biases, techniques like debiasing embeddings can be adapted, which remove or neutralize biased dimensions. Regular testing for bias and fairness while introducing diverse and representative training data is a must. Transparency and Accountability: Transparency and accountability are another aspect that needs to be considered while dealing with embedding models. The advanced embedding model represents data in dimensions that range in the hundreds, which is incomprehensible and affects the outcomes of AI systems. Hence, developers should focus on being transparent about training data and the choice of models. Conclusion Embedding models are the cornerstone of modern AI that allows powerful models to process high dimensional data which was previously impossible. The evolution of word embeddings from Word2Vect and GloVe to state-of-the-art models like BERT and GPT has enabled new possibilities in NLP, computer vision, and recommendation systems. As current models start to evolve and shape the world, it becomes inevitable to understand embedding models. Understanding their use cases equips us to build powerful AI systems that transform conventional tasks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a hot topic in the tech industry, with opinions ranging from it being a revolutionary boom to a potential doom. It has raised a big question: Artificial Intelligence dilemma, a shortcut or a Roadblock? AI has undeniably transformed the field of technology, significantly speeding up development processes. Before the advent of Artificial Intelligence(AI) tools, developing a full-stack web application could take over a month. Now, with clear requirements, it can be accomplished in less than a week. This acceleration is indeed fascinating, especially for senior developers who can leverage AI to enhance their productivity. However, the impact of AI on junior developers is a different story. While AI tools offer a quick path to creating sophisticated applications, they also pose a significant risk: over-reliance. Junior developers, who are just entering the tech field, may become too dependent on these tools, potentially hindering their long-term growth and understanding of fundamental concepts. The Artificial Intelligence Dilemma: Efficiency vs. Learning Imagine two developers, a junior and a senior tasked with building a full-stack e-commerce web application. The junior developer is allowed to use any AI tool, while the senior developer must rely solely on their technical skills, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and other resources. Initially, the junior developer’s application might appear more polished and feature-rich. However, the true test comes when both are asked to make small changes without the aid of AI tools. The junior developer, accustomed to AI assistance, might struggle to implement these changes efficiently and bug-free. In contrast, the senior developer, with a deep understanding of the fundamentals, can make the necessary adjustments smoothly. This scenario highlights a critical issue: Junior developers may be skipping essential learning steps by relying too heavily on AI tools. The Importance of Fundamentals One of the major problems observed in junior developers today is a lack of interest in learning the fundamentals. They often want to jump straight into advanced topics and tools without building a strong foundation. This approach can lead to a superficial understanding of technology, making it difficult to troubleshoot issues or adapt to new challenges without AI assistance. The Future of Software Development Despite the concerns, it’s unlikely that software developers or engineers will lose their jobs to AI. Instead, Artificial Intelligence will likely change the workflow, making processes more efficient. The role of a software engineer might evolve, but it won’t be replaced by AI entirely. The idea of “Software Engineer 2.0” being synonymous with “Machine Learning Engineer” is a misconception. The future will still require developers with a solid grasp of fundamentals, who can use AI tools as an enhancement rather than a crutch. Adapting to the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven workforce A recent study conducted by Pearson, in partnership with ServiceNow, provides an extensive analysis of the potential effects of AI and automation on the economies of six countries (U.S., UK, Germany, India, Australia, and Japan) and how technology-based roles are expected to evolve. Despite concern from potentially affected groups, this research shows that junior application developers will remain valuable even as AI continues to evolve. The study suggests that in the coming years, those junior developers who can understand and adapt to their new roles will be best prepared to thrive in the AI-driven workforce of the future. The rise of AI and automation significantly impacts the skills required for junior developers to succeed in the tech industry. By analyzing their workflows and identifying areas where automation can provide the most significant value, developers can implement automation tools and processes, freeing time for more complex work. Project-based learning is a popular and effective way for new developers to gain hands-on experience and apply their coding skills to real-world challenges. However, this approach also presents its own set of unique challenges. Many new developers encounter pitfalls, but mastering code quality can set them apart in a competitive industry. Conclusion AI tools offer tremendous potential for accelerating development and enhancing productivity. However, for junior developers, over-reliance on these tools can be a double-edged sword. While they provide a quick path to creating complex applications, they can also hinder the learning of essential fundamentals. The key is to strike a balance: use AI tools to augment your skills, but never at the expense of understanding the core principles of software development. By doing so, junior developers can grow into well-rounded, competent professionals capable of adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

{"id": "sunway_59", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/2025/03/", "title": "No Title", "content": "March 2025 - Sunway College Kathmandu AI is changing the world, from personalizing education to speeding up legal proceedings. Nepal is starting to have some serious conversations about how to bring AI into both classrooms and courtrooms. Sounds great, right? Smarter learning, fewer court delays, and even fewer “lost” files at government offices. But before we start imagining an AI-powered utopia, let’s take a step back and ask: Are we actually ready for this? AI in Education : Smarter Learning or Just Smarter Cheating? There’s no doubt that AI could make education better-adaptive learning, instant feedback, automated grading. No more teachers drowning in piles of homework, no more students struggling to keep up in one-size-fits-all lessons. Sounds perfect. Except... we all know what’s actually going to happen. The minute AI becomes a classroom staple, half the students will be using it to actually learn , while the other half will figure out how to get ChatGPT to do their homework while they scroll TikTok. Teachers, instead of grading essays, will be busy trying to figure out if a real student wrote that beautifully worded analysis on Shakespeare-or if it was just AI flexing its literary muscles. At a recent consultation on AI in education, officials, tech experts, and educators sat down to discuss what this all means for Nepal. Baikuntha Prasad Aryal from the Ministry of Education pointed out that we need to integrate AI into schools now if we don’t want to fall behind. But it’s not as simple as flipping a switch. Nepal has to make sure AI is being used to bridge gaps , not widen them. Because if we’re not careful, we’ll end up in a situation where fancy private schools have AI-powered tutors while public schools are still struggling with basic internet access. Michael Croft from UNESCO put it best-if we don’t have a clear plan, we’ll be left with chaos. And honestly, Nepal has enough of that already. AI in the Courts: A Fix for Legal Backlogs or a Future of Robot Judges? Over in the legal world, AI is being pitched as the ultimate analytical person. Nepal’s court system has been drowning in backlogged cases for years , so AI could be a game changer. Imagine an AI-powered system organizing case files, scheduling hearings, and sorting through mountains of paperwork in seconds. The dream! But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. While AI is great at analyzing data, the law isn’t about data. It’s about human judgment, cultural context, and sometimes, the ability of a judge to stare at a witness until they crack under the pressure. Can AI do that? Probably not. And then there’s the issue of bias. AI is only as good as the data it learns from. If we feed it outdated, biased legal precedents, it’s just going to spit out decisions that reinforce the same old problems. Also, let’s not forget-Nepal’s legal system deals with some wild cases. Imagine an AI judge trying to settle a property dispute over a sacred cow . Would it suggest a fair legal rule, or would it just start Googling “cow ownership laws” and crash from confusion? Data security is another big concern. Nepal’s courts handle a lot of sensitive information. If AI systems aren’t built with proper safeguards, we could be looking at some serious privacy issues. The last thing we need is a legal database getting hacked and people’s private case details ending up who-knows-where . So, What’s the Plan? AI isn’t here to replace teachers or judges here to assist them. In schools, AI should make learning more engaging and personalized, not turn students into expert-level AI users who never actually study . In courts, AI should help speed up the system, not take over decision-making. Because the last thing Nepal needs is a court ruling delayed because the AI judge needed a software update . If we do this right, AI could genuinely make Nepal’s education and legal systems faster, smarter, and fairer . But if we rush in without a plan, we could be looking at a future where students don’t actually learn, and AI judges accidentally hand out life sentences for traffic violations . The future is exciting-but only if we don’t let AI run wild. Inspired by: UNESCO’s consultation on AI in Nepal’s education system and how it could change learning experiences. Discussions from the Kathmandu Post on AI’s potential role in the judiciary while keeping human judgment at the center. The very real possibility of students using AI to “study” without actually learning anything. The even bigger possibility of AI judges completely misinterpreting Nepal’s very complex legal system.

{"id": "sunway_60", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/2025/02/", "title": "No Title", "content": "February 2025 - Sunway College Kathmandu In a move that has sparked significant discussion across various sectors, the Nepalese government recently presented the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS in the National Assembly. Tabled by the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, the Bill aims to regulate the growing use of social media platforms, holding users and operators accountable for their actions. While the government cites its goal of promoting social goodwill, cultural tolerance, and good governance, there are growing concerns about how this Bill will impact students, particularly in terms of their freedom of expression and online engagement. Understanding the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS The bill seeks to establish clear guidelines for social media operators and users, focusing on ensuring a safe and secure digital environment. Among its key provisions, it outlines the following: Licensing for Digital Platforms: Companies or institutions operating digital platforms will need to obtain a license, valid for two years, to run social media sites in Nepal. Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to the revocation of their operating license. Content Regulations: The Bill targets cyberbullying, identity theft, misinformation, hate speech, deep fake videos, and other harmful digital behaviors. It also aims to control the spread of content that could jeopardize national peace, security, or sovereignty. Fines and Penalties: Users who engage in harmful online activities such as trolling, spreading false information, or engaging in online harassment could face fines of up to Rs 500,000. This would affect students who are active on social media platforms, potentially limiting their ability to express themselves freely. How Will This Affect Nepalese Students? Impact on Freedom of Expression One of the main concerns about the bill is its potential effect on freedom of speech and expression. While the government’s intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online. Education and Learning Many students rely on social media platforms for educational content, online courses, webinars, and knowledge-sharing. However, the new Bill’s stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill. Online Privacy and Data Security One of the Bill’s main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and Accountability With fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bill’s broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the “wrong intention,” means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media Landscape The implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital Environment As Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

{"id": "sunway_65", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09/", "title": "No Title", "content": "September 2023 - Sunway College Kathmandu I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and I’m excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, it’s not that straightforward. 🍿 Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, it’s essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Here’s what I discovered: 📉 Decline in Length: Genres like Children’s and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content. 📈 Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friend’s data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization , boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021 . Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If we’re going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas . But first we’ll need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Let’s start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python : a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. We’ll also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Let’s perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friend’s assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friend’s aggregations, we’re limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path \"datasets/netflix_data.csv\" . Let’s create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friend’s data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type . Scanning the column, it’s clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show (perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons)? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie . While we’re at it, we don’t need information from all of the columns, so let’s create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title , country , genre , release_year , and duration . Let’s put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. We’ve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Let’s try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so let’s try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much rmative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Let’s filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as “Children”, “Stand-Up”, and “Documentaries”. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For rmation, you can refer to the documentation here ! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, we’ll also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use() . The latter isn’t taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find rmation on customizing the style of your plot here ! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as children’s movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we can’t know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, you’ve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas . This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas . We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri If you are a +2 graduate who is thinking of applying for Merit Based IT Scholarship worth Rs.2 crore for BSc (Hons) Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence (AI) , please see below to check if the college from which you graduated +2 is a partner institution with DigiSchool and UK colleges: Partner Institutions - DigiSchool: Aksharaa School Amrit Secondary Boarding School Baba School Baby Star Montessori Pvt.

{"id": "sunway_67", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07/", "title": "No Title", "content": "July 2023 - Sunway College Kathmandu Generative AI revolutionizes the creative process by allowing humans to supervise while machines generate. This shift relieves us from tedious, risky, and challenging tasks. Similarly, it also enables us to concentrate on the core aspects of our work: vision, ideas, and purpose. It represents a transformative change in the future of employment. Importance of Generative AI Generative AI, like photography and celluloid film, represents an incredible creative revolution. It reduces the necessity for creative skill in painting or singing, just as photography emancipated us from relying entirely on artists to depict the truth. The influence of Generative AI goes beyond creativity. It gives rapid access to clear information and the automatic development of varied material. Material such as news stories, product descriptions, bespoke designs, music, visual effects, and more. It is redefining specialized professions. Additionally, it is also redefining our view of work. AI models increasingly aid with repetitive or computational activities in the manufacturing process. How is Generative AI different from other AI? In contrast to other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI focuses on producing new material, whereas discriminative AI classifies existing data. Generative AI is used for picture production, video synthesis , language generation, and music composition. It is one of the subcategories of artificial intelligence. It encompasses various activities done by AI systems. Reactive machines for self-driving cars, limited memory AI for weather forecasting, theory of mind for virtual customer assistance, narrow AI for personalized product suggestions in e-commerce, supervised learning for object identification, unsupervised learning for fraud detection in banking, and reinforcement learning for teaching machines to play games are all examples of these tasks. Generative AI encompasses several of these areas and continues to grow, with its primary goal being the production of new material, whether writing, graphics, or product suggestions. How does Generative AI work? To recognize patterns and produce new results, generative AI employs techniques such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms. It learns the basic principles guiding the content by studying a vast dataset. It generates fresh data by sampling from a previously learned distribution. The model refines the output to fit the desired outcome through a process known as “inference,” making it more realistic and aligned with user preferences. Generative AI Models 1. Natural Language Model Natural Language Model is the most well-known model of Generative AI, with ChatGPT making headlines. The majority of the excitement around text-based Generative AI is centered on a model known as GPT-3. It’s a language model created by OpenAI, a research group dedicated to the development and promotion of friendly AI. For example, while computers cannot “understand” language in the same way that humans can, natural language technologies are becoming more effective at identifying the context and meaning of phrases and words and converting them into suitable responses-and actions. 2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a well-known form of Generative AI. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator that work together to enhance the generator’s ability to generate realistic data. Over time, the generator improves its capacity to synthesize lifelike data, resulting in the creation of new items, assets, faces, and even people. GANs can be utilized for various applications, including generating natural features such as lightning, leaves, roots, eyes, and flowers, as well as seamlessly integrating humans with nature. Furthermore, in the context of financial fraud detection, GAN models can generate synthetic fraudulent transactions to train fraud detection algorithms. 3. VAE and Anomaly Detection Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are a major model used for anomaly identification. It entails training the model on a collection of normal data and then utilizing it to detect occurrences that deviate from the norm. VAE has applications in a variety of fields, including financial fraud detection, discovering defects in manufacturing processes, and detecting network breaches. For example, Google has used VAE to identify network attacks. Future Prediction Generative AI will continue to play a critical role in computer graphics, animation, and 3D modeling in the gaming, film, and marketing industries. It will also be employed in the next decade or so to improve virtual assistants’ and chatbots’ natural language understanding, allowing them to conduct complicated discussions. In the future, generative AI will help to create realistic simulations in sectors like architecture and engineering, create new materials and products in manufacturing and textile design, and aid in natural language production for news articles, novels, and movie screenplays. Conclusion In terms of utility and predictability, generative AI is similar to a camera, acting as a powerful instrument in the hands of people. Just like a camera performs reliably, generative AI follows the same pattern each time it is used. It enables people to use their skills to generate content, develop new solutions, and explore creative possibilities. Users may leverage the potential of generative AI to improve productivity, accelerate improvements, and stimulate discoveries by understanding and utilizing its consistent nature.

Threads allow you to see a feed of everything that’s going on with your friends or persons you’re interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? They’ve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before they’re able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because it’s linked to your Instagram account, you won’t have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads’ unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new People’s Choice hero. They’ve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside. Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment. What makes Twitter differ from Threads? Threads vs Twitter Twitter’s unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives. The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union. Automatic Status Sharing The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations. Threads intelligently recognize and share information about a user’s current status, such as location, movement, or even the music they are listening to, using powerful AI algorithms . While these capabilities may raise privacy concerns for some users, the app assures that users control information sharing, emphasizing transparency and consent. Conclusion Threads intended to debut in a minimal, stable state for V1, resembling Twitter with deliberate Instagram design aspects. Moreover, it is appropriately called since users have begun to refer to Threads as strings of messages, and it’s straightforward, with your newsfeed consisting of individuals you follow and those you don’t. It nails the basics-visually appealing, runs smoothly, almost bug-free-making it a less overwhelming alternative to Twitter.

Most Popular Terms in Data Science To understand data science, here are a few of the basic keywords and terms that you need to know about today. Algorithms: In computer science, we can define an algorithm as a specific set of processes used to solve a problem or perform computation. Algorithms are hardware and software-specific instruction lists that complete the given process in hand. For example, the simplest of algorithms perform tasks like sorting a set of numbers in descending order, while the most complex set of algorithms guide and work on a natural language processing system. In the field of data science, professionals widely employ algorithms. Given the focus on big data, data scientists need precise algorithms to reduce processing times and operational costs significantly. Some of the common algorithms used in the field of data science include Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting algorithms, etc. Data Mining: We can define data mining as the process of converting raw data into useful information. Data mining involves looking into large sets of data in a database, analyzing patterns and behaviors of the data entities, and using the result to create better algorithms, strategies , and plans for the business. Data science, as the name suggests, heavily operates on data. Therefore, it means it requires a large amount of data to work with. It involves various data mining and warehousing techniques on the data with classification, clustering, and predictive analysis of the given data. Large companies use data mining to create better algorithms, understand customer behavior, and create AI and ML-powered hardware and software. Big Data Big Data can be defined as data, that is BIG (literally!) . It defines large volumes of data that can be structured or unstructured , mined from various sources in a large quantity. Five Vs define big data: Variety, Volume, Velocity, Value, and Veracity. Big Data is sourced from large, complex sources. Big Data poses a unique challenge addressed by data science. It is a massive capital for businesses and companies that can analyze this data to understand customer behavior, insightful analysis of products and services offered, and predict their purchase and usage behavior. Data science uses various algorithms and processes to derive insights from big data. Deep Learning In computer science, we can define deep learning as the process of machine learning that uses structures similar to human brains (called neural networks). Deep learning is used to make better algorithms, data sets, and AI hardware and software. Deep learning uses powerful computers and large sets of data with output (called supervised learning ) and without output (called unsupervised learning ) to understand and predict patterns and outcomes. In Data Science, we employ the use of neural networks and methodologies to study big data with massive models on a large level computational scale. Usually, we utilize deep learning to create better algorithms, and insights on specifics such as user experience of a product, facial recognition, behavior pattern processing, etc. Data science combines the power of deep learning, data, and computer science to generate new insights and value for businesses. Web Scraping Web scraping is the web data extraction process used to extract data from websites . Automated technology retrieves bulk unstructured data, typically HTML, from numerous websites in the process known as web scraping. A database methodically stores structured data, facilitating its utilization for analysis, training, and research purposes. Data scientists use various existing frameworks such as Scrapy, a Python-based web crawler. Data scientists prefer Beautiful Soup, a tool akin to extracting and storing large website data in databases. Therefore, we use web scraping for price monitoring across e-commerce platforms and email marketing. Similarly, emotion analysis across social media platforms and news monitoring purposes are also done using web scraping. Moreover, this data can also be fed to machine learning algorithms for training and prediction purposes. Natural Language Processing (NLP): One of the most frequent data science terms. Natural Language Processing is a subfield of deep learning that is concerned with Human Linguistics . It is the process of identifying and understanding meaningful phrases from a human language and generating meaningful phrases and sentences that look like a natural form . NLP includes two sub-sections, Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Natural Language Processing involves five phases. Lexical (structure) analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, discourse integration, and pragmatic analysis . Some of the well-known areas of NLP are Speech recognition (Siri, Google Assistant), Chatbots(Maya chat, ), and Optical Character recognition (Google Lens,).

At Sunway College, we have a dedicated research lab (Sunway College Research Lab) where we focus on experimenting and researching different IoT-based devices. Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research. One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha (and team) have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at (March 2021 Intake). Let’s have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor ? The rise of IoT (Internet of Things) is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system ‘ IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor ’ is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. There’s usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 (Temperature-Humidity Sensor) Bread Board DS18B20 (Water Temperature Sensor) Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil & Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, let’s understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the project’s outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result & Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ide’s serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometer’s serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of . I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway College’s research lab and beyond that.

Introduction: In the world of computers and the internet, most people compete with Mac and Windows, just like comparing iOS and Android not knowing there is something known as Linux. If you are a tech student or one into computers, you might have heard about Linux somewhere. If you’re new to Linux and want to understand why it’s gaining popularity, then this guide, “Linux for Beginners” is for you. Linux is a powerful, secure, and open-source operating system that has become a viable alternative to Windows and macOS. Whether you’re a student, developer, or casual user, Linux offers flexibility and customization to suit your needs. But where have you used it is the question. Those who have not used Linux or maybe have heard it for the first time should know why it is one of the greatest fields to explore. And if you think that it has a great field then why is it not being known as an alternative to Windows and ios, well in reality Linux is used more than these actually, the majority of the world’s cloud computing servers are Linux based. It is a dominating OS for web servers, database servers, and other applications that power the majority of internet services. It is also used in embedded systems like smartwatches, Bluetooth speakers, thermostats cars, and many more. The Android that the majority of you talk about is based on Linux itself, not just that more than 500 computers are using Linux as their operating system, and hackers or expert programmers prefer Linux compared to other OS. So the question arises should we switch to Linux? Should we switch to Linux? We just talked about Linux being used by hackers and developers, not just that I also told you guys about Linux being used in the supercomputer so it means Linux is really fast and cool right? Well not exactly. The majority of Linux is perceived faster because there is no such bloatware like Windows and is lightweight compared to MacOS, so the majority of tasks might feel better in performance compared to other OS but this will depend on your system. I told you about the system cause Linux runs on almost anything and I mean it. Let me tell you more about its advantages. Reasons to Choose Linux Security and Privacy Unlike Mac and Windows, Linux is far secure with strong security features such as no such things as forced updates which are the most irritating things in the majority of OS, and no bloatware and spyware. Unlike other OS, Linux does not track its users and try to fetch their user data, Linux instead provides you full control over the system and lets you decide what to do. One fun thing about is that the majority of viruses in the world are designed for either Windows or MacOS so by default there are very less viruses ever designed that work on Linux making it more secure Open Source and Free: I just told you about how Linux gives us whole control and is transparent to us and this is what developers love about it and thus call it Open source as we can get to know how it was made and how to configure it all on the internet and all for free. So instead of paying for licenses for OS like Windows and macOS, we can just get Linux for free. Just being free makes this a great choice for students and budget-conscious users Performance and Efficiency I talked about hardware to you and why I brought it was because Linux can run on almost all hardware, Linux is lightweight and optimized for performance making it a great choice to revive your old laptop that becomes buggy and slow due to Windows. Just install Linux and feel it as if it’s new. Things to remember before Downloading Linux as a beginner to Linux Hardware Compatibility: Personally, when I downloaded Linux on old hardware there were no such issues like this but when I switched to new-gen laptops a lot of problems arose such as hardware not supporting, divrives not responding and the keyboard not functioning. These are common in Linux as the Linux you download is not fully built according to your laptop but in general consideration of what a simple device looks, so as you get more new gen computer you need to switch to better Linux or download all the hardware and drivers to the current Linux which might be quite hard for new users. Software compatibility: Not just hardware and drivers, so many software are not compatible with Linux too for instance majority of editing software like MS Office, Adobe Platform, and more are not available in Linux normally, we need to hardcode and download them from a third, and still it may not support fully. While Linux does provide you alternatives to this application they may not be that good as you are familiar with the original ones in Windows and MacOS Gaming While Linux gaming has come a long way, many major games still don’t support Linux natively, and you may need Wine or Proton (via Steam) to run Windows-based games, which isn’t always perfect and can require extra configuration. Learning Curve Linux has a steeper learning curve, especially if you’re used to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Windows or macOS. The majority of you have not used a terminal at all and the majority have a GUI for everything so switching from that is hard. You might have to use the terminal (command line) for certain tasks, and troubleshooting often requires technical knowledge. It requires more and more manual setup which might be hard for first-time users. A Ray of Hope For the Passionate Ones With so harsh truth about Linux majority of people have already given up using Linux, but is it bad? Can we use Linux despite these hurdles? Absolutely. And today, we’re here to shine a light on why Linux is still worth it. It may not be a smooth ride but a ride you will always cherish. We can solve most of these problems actually, firstly for driver hardware and software, we can choose a proper distro for this. What is a distro you say? So Linux has a lot of Operating Systems you can choose from each providing a collection of software packages such as system libraries, utilities, application software, and a desktop environment which makes each distro unique. And if you are a beginner and want to experience Linux with more GUI like your old OS but have Linux in it I have the best suggestion for you which supports a lot of your favorite Windows and Mac software and your deceived hardware and drivers too - introducing Zorin OS! Why Choose Zorin OS 1. Windows-Like Interface Adapting to the Linux desktop environment stands as the biggest problem like we said for people new to the Linux operating system. The Zorin OS desktop adopts an interface that resembles Windows which eases the transition process for Windows users. It also has an appearance for macOS users which is the same as Mac. 2. Easy Installation Process The installation of Zorin OS remains simple because the user-friendly setup wizard provides an easy experience.

Understanding Financial Fraud in Nepal The financial sector in Nepal is growing quickly, and fintech and digital banking are becoming more and more common. However, financial fraud has also increased because of this growth, and this includes: Identity theft: Criminals carry out fraudulent transactions using stolen personal data. Phishing scams: Con artists trick people into divulging private information. Money laundering: Lawful companies or banking channels are used to finance illicit funds. Unauthorized transactions and card skimming: When fraudsters obtain card information, they utilize it to make unlawful purchases. Loan fraud: Using fictitious identities or documents to apply for loans. Social Engineering Attacks: Using dishonest methods, scammers coerce victims into disclosing private information. These dishonest practices undermine public confidence in financial institutions and result in large financial losses. Sophisticated fraud strategies are becoming too difficult to detect using traditional methods that rely on rule-based systems and manual monitoring. AI is a game-changer in this situation. How AI Aids in the Fight Against Financial Fraud Instantaneous Fraud Identification Real-time transaction analysis is used by AI-powered fraud detection systems to spot questionable activity. To identify odd trends and flag possibly fraudulent transactions, machine learning models are trained on enormous volumes of historical transaction data. Identifying Anomalies Anomalies that differ from typical transaction behavior can be detected using AI algorithms. For example, the system can immediately flag a large foreign transaction for examination if a customer who often makes minor transactions suddenly starts one. Analytics for Prediction Based on historical patterns and consumer behaviour, AI can forecast possible fraud. Financial institutions can determine whether a transaction is likely to be fraudulent before it is executed by employing predictive modeling. Authentication via Biometrics Biometric authentication driven by AI, including voice recognition, fingerprint scanning, and facial recognition, improves security and guards against identity theft. Fraud Detection Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) To identify phishing attempts and fraudulent communications, AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) algorithms examine emails, messages, and phone conversations. Chatbots using AI for Customer Verification AI chatbots can lower the danger of fraudulent account access by leveraging multi-factor authentication to confirm customers’ identities. Integrating Blockchain and AI By offering an unchangeable ledger for financial transactions, blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) can improve transaction security. Blockchain transactions can be examined by AI to look for fraudulent trends. AI’s advantages for preventing fraud • Accuracy and Efficiency: AI increases the accuracy of fraud detection while lowering false positives. • Speed: Real-time transaction analysis stops fraud before it starts. • Scalability: AI is capable of handling enormous transaction volumes without the need for human involvement. • Lower Operational Costs: Automation powered by AI reduces the requirement for human fraud detection. • Increased Customer Trust: Customers are more confident in digital banking services when they are in a safe financial environment. • Adaptive Learning: Over time, AI systems become more efficient as they continuously pick up new fraud tendencies. AI Implementation Challenges in Nepal’s Financial Sector • Data Limitations: Large datasets are necessary for developing AI models, but Nepal frequently has insufficient data collection. • Privacy and Regulatory Issues: To guarantee the ethical application of AI, data privacy regulations need to be reinforced. • High Implementation Costs: Adopting AI may be expensive for many banks and financial institutions in Nepal. • Lack of AI Expertise: To deploy and operate AI-based fraud detection systems, Nepal’s banking sector needs qualified AI specialists. • Cybersecurity Risks: Although AI improves security, hackers may use it to create increasingly complex fraud schemes. Future of AI in Financial Fraud Prevention Financial institutions in Nepal must give AI-driven fraud prevention methods top priority considering the growing digital use and AI breakthroughs. A more secure financial ecosystem can be created through cooperation between banks, fintech businesses, and regulatory agencies. To improve fraud protection capabilities, deep learning models, blockchain technology, and behavioral analytics will be integrated into increasingly sophisticated AI-powered fraud detection. Additionally, more money will be spent on AI research and development. Nepal moves forward with its digital transformation to create solutions that are especially suited to the local financial environment. To increase awareness and security, financial literacy initiatives should also teach consumers about AI-based fraud protection techniques. In conclusion, by offering real-time detection, predictive analysis, and improved authentication techniques, AI has the potential to drastically lower financial fraud in Nepal. Even though there are still obstacles to overcome, adopting AI proactively can improve Nepal’s financial stability and promote confidence in online transactions. As we are getting more technology exposure here in Nepal, a lot of new methods and changes have been seen in multiple. But not quite much in the banking sector. As smartphones are now available almost all over the country, it is no surprise that Artificial Intelligence is also starting to pop here. However, like technology, Nepal’s banking sector has been slower compared to other sectors. Banks in Nepal, while modernizing and adopting new techniques, are still hesitant to fully accept AI. This is mainly due to the terms of infrastructure regulation, and trust. But as Nepal’s financial services sector continues to evolve, AI offers multiple services: personalized services and many more. It also offers smarter risk management and more secure transaction processes. So let’s see and explore why the banking sector is slow in this trend. Similarly, let’s explore what opportunity this technology holds, and how we can benefit from this system. The Challenge of AI Adoption in Nepal’s Banking Sector Regulatory and Compliance Concerns Nepal’s banking system operates under a strict regulatory framework. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank of Nepal, closely monitors financial institutions. Additionally, it ensures the safety and security of customer deposits and financial systems. While there are regulations regarding AI being adopted globally at a slow pace, Nepal’s banking sector is particularly cautious. This is due to the lack of clear guidelines on how to implement AI technologies within the confines of its regulatory environment. For instance, the NRB’s existing regulation, which focuses mainly on traditional banking methods, might not fully be compatible with the data-driven nature of AI. With AI systems relying heavily on data, including sensitive customer information, its compliance with NEpal’s privacy act and others becomes even more complex. Therefore there is a rooted hesitation in implementing AI solutions as the main concern is data security and regulatory oversight. 1. Data Security and Privacy As said, Data Security remains a concerning topic and a top priority for Banks. As AI requires large datasets to function effectively, the risk of security breaches and data misuse is a growing concern. It is also to be noted that Nepal’s Banking system is often targeted by cybercriminals and this kind of news on people’s data being breached or leaked is common. To reduce this an AI should have a secure system to mitigate threats like fraud, hacking, and identity theft. In Nepal where the digital payment system is just a new innovative step compared to other countries who have already introduced this system years ago and yet still begot one or two problems in the well-established payment system we use today. Now, introducing AI to this field and trusting that AI’s ability to keep personal and financial data is very hard. To do this we will require time and a lot of data to train the model. Additionally meeting the demand of both customers and regulators in the process is also important. 2. Infrastructure and Legacy Systems Many banks in Nepal still operate on legacy traditional systems. The systems are not designed to integrate with the advanced features of AI. Unlike other countries where banks have new cutting-edge technology, Nepali financial institutions often operate on older core banking systems. The cost and risk of upgrading this system can be problematic, especially for smaller or regional banks. Additionally, the high quantity data for training ML models, is a hectic process here as majority of data collection , storage and sharing are oftenfragmented which creates another roadblock for Ai-driven solution. As a result, banks are very serious and cautious in the approach of Ai integration and monthly reluctant to overhaul the existing system that they are comfortable with. 3. Skill Gap AI itself is a new concept introduced in Nepal. The skills required to develop and manage AI are thus limited here. While there has been growth in the tech industry, the specialized knowledge needed to operate AI-driven tools. But in the banking sector or any other sector, such tools are quite limited. Data Scientists, machine learning engineers, and Ai specialists are in high demand globally, and Nepal’s banking sector faces the same shortage of talents. The Opportunities of AI in Nepal’s Banking Sector Despite these challenges, the potential for Ai in Nepal’s banking sector is huge, and here is how Ai can make a difference: 1. Personalized Banking Services The Nepalese banking sector focuses on customer service enhancement as mobile banking services expand their reach to residents of urban and rural Nepal. The implementation of AI enables Nepali banks to deliver customized products that specifically address the personal requirements of their individual customers. AI-powered chatbots provide round-the-clock customer support facilities that handle inquiries and transactions alongside personalized financial recommendations based on user spending behavior. The increase in Nepali consumers choosing mobile and digital banking platforms will drive escalated requirements for personalized banking services across the industry. AI systems examine financial records in combination with payment behaviors and societal indicators to customize financial services that let users improve their money management strategies. 2. Fraud Detection and Prevention The growth of digital banking across Nepal has produced intensified banking fraud cases affecting the industry. Artificial intelligence functions as a reliable instrument to both find and halt fraudulent behavior. AI leverages real-time transaction analysis through machine learning algorithms to spot unexpected spending activities which then allows it to notify bank customers or the institution before major financial losses occur. AI technology assists Nepali banks to discover credit card abuse together with money laundering and identity theft leading to enhanced cybersecurity protection. The implementation of AI would deliver necessary security measures when Nepali banks plan to expand their digital services. 3. Operational Efficiency Bank institutions throughout Nepal together with international financial institutions seek continuous methods to minimize operational costs and enhance operational efficiency. The implementation of AI solutions enables banks to execute repetitive duties like data recording together with loan analysis while running credit ratings besides checking against industry regulations. The implementation of AI leads banks to achieve better operational efficiency with reduced costs. The Nepalese banking system which maintains mostly manual and paper-intensive services can experience rapid progress thanks to AI applications. Benefits from this approach would improve the customer journey while simultaneously lowering both operational expenses and human-related service shortcomings. Conclusion The banking sector in Nepal is approaching an era of artificial intelligence transformation. The banking sector of Nepal faces ongoing challenges linked to regulatory checkpoints and limited infrastructure. In addition to the shortage of capable personnel but the promise of AI to enhance customer service and operations exists in direct proportion to its capacity to boost security measures. Future improvements in Nepal’s digital environment will make artificial intelligence essential for banking organizations. It will make us want to stay competitive while serving customers who use technology. The banking sector in Nepal will adapt AI capabilities at a moderate pace given that future prospects appear positive. If Nepal’s financial institutions establish plans, gain regulatory certainty and prioritize data security then they can use AI to develop an efficient banking system that is centered on customer needs and secured operations. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a hot topic in the tech industry, with opinions ranging from it being a revolutionary boom to a potential doom. It has raised a big question: Artificial Intelligence dilemma, a shortcut or a Roadblock? AI has undeniably transformed the field of technology, significantly speeding up development processes. Before the advent of Artificial Intelligence(AI) tools, developing a full-stack web application could take over a month. Now, with clear requirements, it can be accomplished in less than a week. This acceleration is indeed fascinating, especially for senior developers who can leverage AI to enhance their productivity. However, the impact of AI on junior developers is a different story. While AI tools offer a quick path to creating sophisticated applications, they also pose a significant risk: over-reliance. Junior developers, who are just entering the tech field, may become too dependent on these tools, potentially hindering their long-term growth and understanding of fundamental concepts. The Artificial Intelligence Dilemma: Efficiency vs. Learning Imagine two developers, a junior and a senior tasked with building a full-stack e-commerce web application. The junior developer is allowed to use any AI tool, while the senior developer must rely solely on their technical skills, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and other resources. Initially, the junior developer’s application might appear more polished and feature-rich. However, the true test comes when both are asked to make small changes without the aid of AI tools. The junior developer, accustomed to AI assistance, might struggle to implement these changes efficiently and bug-free. In contrast, the senior developer, with a deep understanding of the fundamentals, can make the necessary adjustments smoothly. This scenario highlights a critical issue: Junior developers may be skipping essential learning steps by relying too heavily on AI tools. The Importance of Fundamentals One of the major problems observed in junior developers today is a lack of interest in learning the fundamentals. They often want to jump straight into advanced topics and tools without building a strong foundation. This approach can lead to a superficial understanding of technology, making it difficult to troubleshoot issues or adapt to new challenges without AI assistance. The Future of Software Development Despite the concerns, it’s unlikely that software developers or engineers will lose their jobs to AI. Instead, Artificial Intelligence will likely change the workflow, making processes more efficient. The role of a software engineer might evolve, but it won’t be replaced by AI entirely. The idea of “Software Engineer 2.0” being synonymous with “Machine Learning Engineer” is a misconception. The future will still require developers with a solid grasp of fundamentals, who can use AI tools as an enhancement rather than a crutch. Adapting to the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven workforce A recent study conducted by Pearson, in partnership with ServiceNow, provides an extensive analysis of the potential effects of AI and automation on the economies of six countries (U.S., UK, Germany, India, Australia, and Japan) and how technology-based roles are expected to evolve. Despite concern from potentially affected groups, this research shows that junior application developers will remain valuable even as AI continues to evolve. The study suggests that in the coming years, those junior developers who can understand and adapt to their new roles will be best prepared to thrive in the AI-driven workforce of the future. The rise of AI and automation significantly impacts the skills required for junior developers to succeed in the tech industry. By analyzing their workflows and identifying areas where automation can provide the most significant value, developers can implement automation tools and processes, freeing time for more complex work. Project-based learning is a popular and effective way for new developers to gain hands-on experience and apply their coding skills to real-world challenges. However, this approach also presents its own set of unique challenges. Many new developers encounter pitfalls, but mastering code quality can set them apart in a competitive industry. Conclusion AI tools offer tremendous potential for accelerating development and enhancing productivity. However, for junior developers, over-reliance on these tools can be a double-edged sword. While they provide a quick path to creating complex applications, they can also hinder the learning of essential fundamentals. The key is to strike a balance: use AI tools to augment your skills, but never at the expense of understanding the core principles of software development. By doing so, junior developers can grow into well-rounded, competent professionals capable of adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer Sci-Fi, it’s here, transforming industries, and AI in healthcare is one of the most promising yet complex domains it’s reshaping. From detecting cancer in medical scans to predicting strokes before they occur, AI has the potential to make healthcare faster, more efficient, and more precise. But alongside these advancements come technical hurdles, ethical dilemmas, and critical questions about how much control we should give to algorithms in life-and-death decisions. So, what does the future of AI in healthcare look like? Let’s explore. The Promise of AI in Healthcare AI in medicine is like having a supercharged doctor with a photographic memory and lightning-fast thinking. It’s already changing the game, spotting diseases like Alzheimer’s and breast cancer earlier and more accurately than ever. Hospitals are using AI to cut down ER wait times and manage resources better, while in drug discovery, breakthroughs like DeepMind’s AlphaFold are rewriting the rules of protein research. Imagine taking a pill crafted exclusively for you designed to target your condition with laser precision, minimize side effects, and accelerate recovery. That’s the promise of personalized medicine. At a biomedical hackathon at Kathmandu University, I got a deep dive into human genetics and discovered how genetic sequencing, protein interactions, and biomarker analysis could unlock this future. Of course, challenges like data privacy and algorithmic bias remain, but one thing is clear-AI is revolutionizing healthcare in the best way possible. Key Challenges in Implementation of AI in HealthCare With great power comes great responsibility-and AI in healthcare is the Spider-Man of modern medicine. It’s got all this dazzling potential, but sorry, folks, it’s not as easy as flicking an “on” switch and calling it a day. AI depends on vast amounts of high-quality data, but medical records are often scattered, incomplete, or trapped in outdated systems. When AI feeds on bad data, it produces unreliable predictions, leading to potential misdiagnoses and treatment errors. The challenge isn’t just collecting data but ensuring it is accurate, standardized, and accessible. Then there’s the cost challenge. Developing and implementing AI isn’t inexpensive-it takes a significant investment for hospitals to bring it on board. Smaller clinics and less-funded regions often can’t keep up, watching from the sidelines as larger institutions adopt the technology. This isn’t just unfortunate-it could deepen the gap in healthcare access, where advanced AI tools are mostly available to well-resourced facilities. Patient care shouldn’t feel exclusive, should it? Then there’s the issue of trust. Doctors aren’t always eager to embrace algorithms-they’ve spent years building their expertise through hands-on experience, not managing software. Many view AI with skepticism, unsure of its role in their practice. Without thorough training and clear evidence that AI supports rather than replaces their judgment, adoption will likely remain gradual. AI’s role in healthcare must be that of an assistant, not an authority-augmenting human expertise rather than attempting to replace it. The potential? Oh, it’s huge -AI could be the rockstar of healthcare. But if we don’t tackle these hiccups, it might just end up as another overhyped gadget gathering dust in the corner. Ethical Concerns Beyond technical and financial barriers, AI in healthcare raises serious ethical questions. Let’s ensure this revolution succeeds, time to address the challenges thoughtfully and focus on effective solutions! Privacy and Data Security AI requires access to extensive patient data to function effectively, but this poses risks. Medical records contain highly sensitive information-who controls access, and how can we ensure data remains secure? Patients deserve transparency and strict safeguards against breaches or misuse. Bias and Fairness AI systems learn from old data, and sometimes that data has a few sneaky flaws. If it shortchanges certain groups, the AI might not treat everyone fairly. Case in point: one fancy AI once underestimated Black patients’ needs because it was fed healthcare spending stats that weren’t quite balanced. Fixing these little hiccups is a must to keep AI healthcare fair for all. Accountability and Trust When AI makes a medical error, who is responsible-the doctor, the developer, or the algorithm itself? Unlike human professionals, AI cannot explain its reasoning in a way we always understand, making accountability difficult. Trust in AI requires transparency, rigorous testing, and the ability for healthcare providers to interpret and validate AI recommendations. NeuroVision: A Case Study in Responsible AI Development One project that highlights AI’s potential, when developed responsibly, is NeuroVision. This initiative uses AI to classify brain tumors from DICOM medical images, based on a proposed technical architecture that integrates deep learning models with cloud-based processing for improved speed and accuracy. The dataset for this system is developed using Functional APIs, which enable efficient handling and structuring of complex medical imaging data. If implemented with proper ethical considerations, it could significantly enhance early tumor detection, leading to faster diagnoses and improved treatment planning. However, for NeuroVision to succeed ethically, several factors must be addressed: Data Transparency & Security : Ensuring patient imaging data is handled with the highest standards of encryption and privacy protection. Bias Mitigation : Training the model on diverse datasets to avoid racial, gender, or socioeconomic disparities in diagnosis. Explainability : Implementing explainable AI (XAI) techniques to help radiologists understand why the AI reached a particular conclusion, rather than treating it as a “black box.” Collaboration with Medical Experts : Ensuring that NeuroVision remains a tool that assists radiologists rather than replaces them, maintaining human oversight in critical decisions. If developed with these ethical pillars in mind, NeuroVision could set an example for responsible AI integration in healthcare, proving that innovation and responsibility can go hand in hand. The Road Ahead: Balancing Innovation and Responsibility The future of AI in healthcare all comes down to finding that sweet spot. We need strong rules to make sure AI plays fair, owns up to its mistakes, and keeps our data safe. And let’s be real-transparency matters. If patients and doctors can’t figure out how AI comes up with its answers, they’re not going to trust it, plain and simple. The trick is teamwork. AI techies, doctors, ethicists, and policymakers have to join forces to build systems that aren’t just cutting-edge but also decent and focused on people. Think of it like a three-legged stool: you’ve got innovation, responsibility, and trust holding it up. Kick one out, and the whole thing comes crashing down. The good news? We’re already seeing some wins. A few hospitals are testing out AI that explains itself, governments are sketching out ethics rules, and researchers are digging into the messy stuff like bias and fairness. Still, we’ve got a ways to go-nobody said this would be a quick fix! Conclusion AI could shake up healthcare-think of quicker diagnoses, sharper treatments, and healthier vibes all around. But let’s not kid ourselves: tech isn’t some magic fix-it wand. It’s more like a trusty tool, and we’ve got to use it right. The point isn’t to swap out doctors for robots-it’s to give them a boost so they can help us better. So, here’s the big question: Can we make sure AI’s got humanity’s back without messing up on ethics, fairness, or trust? If cool projects like NeuroVision show us how to do AI the responsible way, I’d say we’ve got a solid shot at a “heck yes.” What’s your take where do we set the boundaries? AI is changing the world, from personalizing education to speeding up legal proceedings. Nepal is starting to have some serious conversations about how to bring AI into both classrooms and courtrooms. Sounds great, right? Smarter learning, fewer court delays, and even fewer “lost” files at government offices. But before we start imagining an AI-powered utopia, let’s take a step back and ask: Are we actually ready for this? AI in Education : Smarter Learning or Just Smarter Cheating? There’s no doubt that AI could make education better-adaptive learning, instant feedback, automated grading. No more teachers drowning in piles of homework, no more students struggling to keep up in one-size-fits-all lessons. Sounds perfect. Except... we all know what’s actually going to happen. The minute AI becomes a classroom staple, half the students will be using it to actually learn , while the other half will figure out how to get ChatGPT to do their homework while they scroll TikTok. Teachers, instead of grading essays, will be busy trying to figure out if a real student wrote that beautifully worded analysis on Shakespeare-or if it was just AI flexing its literary muscles. At a recent consultation on AI in education, officials, tech experts, and educators sat down to discuss what this all means for Nepal. Baikuntha Prasad Aryal from the Ministry of Education pointed out that we need to integrate AI into schools now if we don’t want to fall behind. But it’s not as simple as flipping a switch. Nepal has to make sure AI is being used to bridge gaps , not widen them. Because if we’re not careful, we’ll end up in a situation where fancy private schools have AI-powered tutors while public schools are still struggling with basic internet access. Michael Croft from UNESCO put it best-if we don’t have a clear plan, we’ll be left with chaos. And honestly, Nepal has enough of that already. AI in the Courts: A Fix for Legal Backlogs or a Future of Robot Judges? Over in the legal world, AI is being pitched as the ultimate analytical person. Nepal’s court system has been drowning in backlogged cases for years , so AI could be a game changer. Imagine an AI-powered system organizing case files, scheduling hearings, and sorting through mountains of paperwork in seconds. The dream! But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. While AI is great at analyzing data, the law isn’t about data. It’s about human judgment, cultural context, and sometimes, the ability of a judge to stare at a witness until they crack under the pressure. Can AI do that? Probably not. And then there’s the issue of bias. AI is only as good as the data it learns from. If we feed it outdated, biased legal precedents, it’s just going to spit out decisions that reinforce the same old problems. Also, let’s not forget-Nepal’s legal system deals with some wild cases. Imagine an AI judge trying to settle a property dispute over a sacred cow . Would it suggest a fair legal rule, or would it just start Googling “cow ownership laws” and crash from confusion? Data security is another big concern. Nepal’s courts handle a lot of sensitive information. If AI systems aren’t built with proper safeguards, we could be looking at some serious privacy issues. The last thing we need is a legal database getting hacked and people’s private case details ending up who-knows-where . So, What’s the Plan? AI isn’t here to replace teachers or judges here to assist them. In schools, AI should make learning more engaging and personalized, not turn students into expert-level AI users who never actually study . In courts, AI should help speed up the system, not take over decision-making. Because the last thing Nepal needs is a court ruling delayed because the AI judge needed a software update . If we do this right, AI could genuinely make Nepal’s education and legal systems faster, smarter, and fairer . But if we rush in without a plan, we could be looking at a future where students don’t actually learn, and AI judges accidentally hand out life sentences for traffic violations . The future is exciting-but only if we don’t let AI run wild. Inspired by: UNESCO’s consultation on AI in Nepal’s education system and how it could change learning experiences. Discussions from the Kathmandu Post on AI’s potential role in the judiciary while keeping human judgment at the center. The very real possibility of students using AI to “study” without actually learning anything. The even bigger possibility of AI judges completely misinterpreting Nepal’s very complex legal system.

{"id": "sunway_74", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/category/blog/reasons-developers-choose-rust/", "title": "No Title", "content": "The Rise of Rust: Why Developers Love It The farming world has always been at the mercy of nature. While farming has seen impressive success through modern practices in improving yield, pest control, and weather management, one constant threat always lingers over agriculture: crop disease. Whether rust in wheat, blight in potato, or mildew in grape, crop disease has long been a thorn in the flesh for farmers. Crop diseases can completely destroy harvests, wiping out small-scale and large-scale farms equally. But what if we could predict crop diseases before they are an issue, allowing farmers to respond to the very first indications that something is amiss. That’s where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in. With the incorporation of advanced machine learning algorithms, image recognition, and real-time data, AI is turning farmers into disease detectives-identifying potential problems well ahead of time before they get out of hand. Let us take a closer look at how AI is revolutionizing the prediction, control, and prevention of crop disease. The Challenge of Crop Diseases Before explaining how AI helps, one needs to understand the scope and magnitude of crop disease. Crop disease is the cause of an astronomical amount of loss of food worldwide annually. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates plant diseases as being to blame for as much as 40% of global crop loss-loss that translates to direct crop damage and cost of pesticides and disease control. Farmers usually rely on a combination of visual inspections, expert judgment, and weather forecasts to predict and manage diseases. But these controls are usually too late or are not specific enough. Diseases are apt to become uncontrollable fast, especially in large fields, and by the time they have been detected, it is too late to avert the harm. Traditional Methods of Disease Detection The ways of detecting crop diseases in the past were fairly primitive: Expert or farmer visual inspections that can easily miss early signs. Field sampling wherein parts of crops are being sent to labs to be analyzed, a slow process that may or may not deliver real-time feedback. Weather predictions, used to identify conditions (rain, temperature, humidity) favorable to disease epidemics, but without information on whether or not a crop in a specific region is indeed infected. These techniques are not as proactive but are rather reactive, and they are normally infested with human elements, lapses in time, and the sheer magnitude of modern-day farms. AI: The Disease Detective Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML), introduces a revolutionized approach to the problem of crop diseases. Machine learning is a branch of AI that enables systems to learn from experience, become more intelligent with time, and take decisions autonomously with minimal human intervention. It can be utilized in agriculture to recognize patterns, predict future events, and generate implementable outcomes. This is how AI is transforming the prediction of crop diseases: 1. Image Recognition for Early Disease Detection One of the most powerful uses of AI in agriculture is image recognition. Crops are captured in high-resolution photos by drones, satellites, and even hand-held cameras. The photos are fed into AI algorithms that have been programmed to see even the smallest indication of disease-often before the human eye can do so. For example: Leaf spots, a first indication of disease, may be identified in an image by machine learning algorithms that have been trained to recognize patterns in leaf shape, texture, and color. Innovative machine learning algorithms can even identify discoloration or wilting symptoms of infection caused by fungi or bacteria through images of the plant. The beauty is that this process can be scaled up. AI can cut through thousands of images from drones or satellite imagery to detect possible outbreaks in real-time, thus allowing early intervention. 2. Predictive Analytics for Disease Forecasting It can also predict the outbreak of disease by analyzing huge ranges of data points. It does not just look for observable clues, but accounts for other variables like: Weather conditions-temperature, rainfall, humidity Soil conditions Crop type and variety Disease history data AI could then present a probability calculation of the occurrence of specific diseases in specific regions, depending on environmental factors and existing patterns from previous seasons. As an illustration, if an AI system detects a high-humidity, high-temperature scenario-ideal for fungal growth-it can initiate farmers to adopt preventive actions like the application of fungicides, adjustment of irrigation schedule, or inspection of vulnerable crop zones. 3. Machine Learning for Continuous Improvement Machine learning programs improve over time. With each new set of data, AI is more and more able to make accurate disease predictions. The more it looks at pictures and the more it consumes from the world around it, the more it will see pre-symptomatic indicators of crop disease. For instance, the deep learning models are usually applied to identify and classify diseases based on plant images. The model continuously learns from the feedback it receives. If the farmer identifies a disease (or not) correctly (or wrongly), the AI platform refines its idea of the disease and improves the predictions. 4. Integration with Internet of Things (IoT) Devices AI predictability is also enhanced when merged with IoT devices on the farm. IoT devices are able to monitor environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real time. When merged with drone or satellite data, the real-time information stream gives the AI system the context of each crop, which makes the disease predictions even more precise. For example, the soil sensors may register low nitrogen levels, a stress factor that can predispose crops to disease infection. The AI system may suggest a specific remedy, for example, the application of fertilizers to boost the plants’ health. Benefits of Using AI for Disease Prediction The impact of using AI for forecasting crop disease is gigantic. Let us consider the most important advantages: 1. Preemptive Disease Management The strongest attribute of AI in the prediction of diseases is to act before a disease becomes entrenched. The traditional way is to react after diseases begin to spread. In contrast, AI allows farmers to catch problems early, at a stage when they can still avoid massive damage. 2. Targeted Interventions Through the application of AI, farmers will be in a position to make more fact-based, informed choices. Instead of spraying fungicides or pesticides over an entire field, AI will determine where the disease is most likely to appear. This makes for better-targeted use of chemicals, saving cash and cutting back on environmental damage. 3. Higher Yield and Lower Losses Disease detection with AI leads to healthier plants and ultimately higher yields. Because the farmers are able to prevent the worst of the disease, they are less likely to incur crushing crop loss, which translates into greater profitability. 4. Cost Savings Prevention of an outbreak of disease is far less expensive than addressing its effects. By accurate prediction of where and when a disease will appear, farmers do not waste money on treatments that are expensive, labor, and replanting. 5. Sustainability Disease forecasting using AI renders agriculture more sustainable by reducing the reliance on high pesticide application and soil fertility. It not only reduces the environmental footprint of agriculture, but also the risk of chemical resistance in pests and diseases is minimized. Real-World Examples of AI in Crop Disease Prediction Plantix (Germany) Plantix, a mobile application for plant health, uses AI and image recognition to help farmers diagnose crop diseases. Farmers take a photo of their plants, and the AI checks the image for disease, pest, or nutrient deficiency. The app then recommends treatment and connects farmers with experts. IBM Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture IBM’s platform uses AI, weather information, and block-chain to allow farmers to foresee and plan against diseases. The platform’s AI uses historical and real-time data and provides predictions on crop health along with recommending specific actions for disease prevention. Crop sensor (USA) Crop sensor uses AI-powered drones and sensors to monitor the health of the crops. AI algorithms analyze the data and predict the likely eruption of diseases and give farmers an early beginning for disease control. The Future of AI in Crop Disease Prediction The future of AI in crop disease prediction looks incredibly promising. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more powerful tools for disease prevention, including: Real-time drone surveillance with AI analysis on the go. More sophisticated weather models predicting disease risks. Automated disease management systems, where AI directly controls drones or sprayers to apply treatments only where needed. The intersection of AI and agriculture isn’t just about making farming more efficient; it’s about saving the planet’s food supply, one smart prediction at a time. Conclusion Artificial Intelligence is transforming crop disease management for farmers by delivering solutions that not only warn when the disease will strike, but also pre-empt its occurrence in the first place. Through predictive analytics, machine learning, and pre-emptive warning, farmers today are more empowered than ever to safeguard their crops, reduce waste, and enhance yield. With advancements in this technology along the lines they’re currently headed, there’s no question that AI will be a part of the future of agriculture-helping us feed more people on this planet more sustainably and efficiently. Agriculturists do not need to wait for the diseases to manifest themselves before acting. With AI, they are able to get ahead and keep their crops-and their businesses-disease-free in the next few years. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept; it’s a global force reshaping industries, economies, and daily life. From optimizing complex systems to personalizing user experiences, AI’s potential is undeniable. Like many nations, Nepal is awakening to this transformative power and grappling with how best to harness it for national development while mitigating potential risks. The recent unveiling of the draft National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy 2081 (corresponding to 2025 AD) signals a significant step in this direction. But is this initial stride enough? This post delves into the current state of AI policy in Nepal. Similarly, identifies crucial missing pieces. Also, explores the necessary next steps to build a robust and beneficial AI ecosystem for the nation, and also speaks about Nepal’s AI policy. The Current Landscape: Nepal’s Initial Steps into AI Governance Nepal’s journey towards formal AI governance isn’t starting from scratch. The Digital Nepal Framework 2076 (2019 AD) laid some groundwork, emphasizing AI, big data, and cloud computing. It worked as a key technological pillar for the nation’s digital transformation. Building on this, the draft National AI Policy 2081, released for public consultation by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MoCIT) in early 2025, marks a dedicated effort to create a strategic framework for AI. Key Highlights of the Draft Policy: Visionary Goals: The policy sets a vision for AI-driven digital transformation, aiming to integrate AI into key economic and social sectors like agriculture, healthcare, tourism, education, and governance to boost productivity and align with national development goals. Institutional Framework: It proposes creating new bodies to guide and regulate AI: National AI Center: To serve as the primary regulatory body overseeing AI growth, usage, and research. AI Regulation Council: Headed by the MoCIT Minister, focusing on ethical oversight, ensuring AI benefits society while respecting human rights and privacy, and aligning with international standards. AI Excellence Centers: To be established in universities and research institutions at national and provincial levels to foster R&D, focusing on ethical data handling and priority sectors. Infrastructure and Ethics: The policy acknowledges the need for expanding digital infrastructure (like 5G, fiber optics, data centers, cloud services) and places a strong emphasis on ethical AI development and regulation. While government-led initiatives are nascent, Nepal’s private sector shows glimpses of AI adoption. Startups like Fuse machines Nepal and Paaila Technology are working on AI-driven solutions in areas like chatbots, automation, and data analytics, particularly in finance, e-commerce, and potentially healthcare. However, this growth remains somewhat limited, often happening in pockets rather than as part of a coordinated national strategy. Identifying the Gaps: What’s Missing in Nepal’s AI Policy Strategy? Despite the commendable intentions laid out in the draft policy, several critical gaps and challenges need addressing for Nepal to effectively leverage AI. 1. The Implementation Chasm : The draft policy outlines ambitious goals but according to analysis, lacks a concrete roadmap. Crucial details regarding responsible agencies, specific funding mechanisms, timelines, and measurable outcomes are missing. Without these, there’s a significant risk of the policy remaining largely aspirational, confined to paper rather than practice. 2. Foundational Weaknesses: Infrastructure & Data: AI thrives on data and robust infrastructure. Nepal faces significant hurdles here: Infrastructure Deficit: Limited high-speed internet penetration, unreliable electricity supply, and inadequate access to advanced computing power and data centers severely restrict AI development and deployment. Data Governance: While the policy mentions data, it needs more explicit policies on data governance, including data quality standards, cleansing, security protocols, privacy protection, and clear regulations for cross-border data sharing. 3. The R&D and Skills Deficit: Meaningful AI development requires strong research capabilities and a skilled workforce. Underfunded R&D: Nepal invests less than 1% of its GDP in research and development, leaving institutions under-resourced. The draft policy encourages university collaboration and research centers, but without a clear financing strategy for AI labs and R&D hubs, Nepal may remain dependent on foreign technology. Talent Gap & Awareness: There’s a recognized shortage of AI professionals and low AI literacy among the broader population. Building a skilled workforce through dedicated educational programs and raising public awareness are critical yet underdeveloped areas. 4. Regulatory Vagueness and Ethical Implementation: While the draft mentions ethics and proposes a council, the governance section needs more teeth. Clearer guidelines are needed on transparency, accountability, bias mitigation, cybersecurity standards, data privacy enforcement (beyond just confidentiality, integrity, availability), and preventing misuse for surveillance or disinformation. The policy needs a well-defined, applicable definition of AI and a comprehensive glossary. 5. Stimulating the Ecosystem : The policy mentions public-private partnerships (PPPs) but lacks concrete details on incentives to encourage private sector investment and AI entrepreneurship. Tax breaks, startup grants, venture capital matching schemes, and dedicated innovation hubs are needed to catalyze the ecosystem, like approaches in countries like India or Singapore. 6. Localization Lag : For AI to be truly inclusive and effective across Nepal, solutions need to be developed and adapted for Nepali and other regional languages and contexts. Charting the Path Forward: What’s Next for Nepal’s AI Policy? Addressing these gaps requires a concerted and strategic effort. The following steps are crucial for Nepal’s AI journey: 1. Finalize and Operationalize the Policy : Incorporate stakeholder feedback (including recommendations from bodies like the CAN Federation) into the draft policy. Most importantly, translate the finalized policy into a clear, actionable, and funded implementation plan with defined roles, responsibilities, and timelines. 2. Build the Bedrock Infrastructure First: Prioritize substantial investment in core digital infrastructure: reliable power, nationwide high-speed internet, and secure, state-of-the-art data centers and cloud capabilities. This is non-negotiable for any serious AI ambition. 3. Invest in People and Ideas: Dramatically increase funding for AI research and development. Establish and adequately resource the proposed AI Excellence Centers. Integrate AI into university curricula, offer scholarships, and launch nationwide AI literacy and upskilling programs. 4. Develop Robust Legal & Ethical Guardrails : Craft clear, specific, and enforceable regulations covering data protection, cybersecurity, ethical AI principles (fairness, transparency, accountability), and responsible AI use. Ensure these legal frameworks protect citizens’ rights while fostering innovation. 5. Catalyze Collaboration and Investment: Design and implement attractive incentives for private sector AI development, startups, and PPPs. Foster a collaborative environment between government, academia, industry, and civil society. Explore strategic international partnerships, potentially learning from models like the Singapore-Rwanda AI Playbook for resource pooling. 6. Prioritize Localization and Sectoral Impact: Actively support the development of AI tools tailored to Nepal’s linguistic and cultural diversity. Continue focusing AI applications on key sectors (agriculture, health, education, disaster management) where they can deliver maximum societal and economic benefits. Artificial Intelligence holds immense potential to accelerate Nepal’s development, enhance public services, and create new economic opportunities. The draft National AI Policy 2081 is a vital first step, signaling the government’s commitment. However, a policy document alone is insufficient. Real work lies ahead: bridging the gap between ambition and action. This requires moving beyond broad statements to concrete implementation plans. Additionally, securing dedicated funding, building foundational infrastructure, nurturing local talent, establishing clear ethical and legal frameworks, and fostering a vibrant ecosystem through collaboration and smart incentives. By addressing the missing pieces and strategically charting the next steps, Nepal can harness the power of AI. It can harness not just to keep pace with the world, but to build a more prosperous and inclusive future. Also, it can harness a resilient future for all its citizens. The journey requires a collective effort, and the government should unite the industry, academia, and the public. It should unite towards a shared vision of responsible and impactful AI development. Introduction: Why Blockchain, Why Now? As the world moves forward with new technologies, Nepal isn’t staying too far behind. We’re seeing more people talk about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning every day, and slowly but surely, Nepal is adopting them too. But here’s something you don’t hear as often-what about blockchain? Why isn’t blockchain getting the same attention in Nepal? Is it just because cryptocurrency is banned here? In this blog, I want to explore the potential of blockchain in Nepal-beyond just crypto. We’ll look at how it works, what’s already happening, and why it could be a game-changer for our country. So, here’s the big question: Is blockchain the tool that can help Nepal grow stronger, smarter, and fairer? What is Blockchain, Really? At a glance, blockchain is an application of Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT). At its core, it’s a digital ledger-a secure, decentralized system that records transactions across a network of computers. Unlike traditional databases controlled by central authorities, blockchain is transparent, tamper-resistant, and maintained collectively by its participants. Though Bitcoin popularized the term, blockchain technology’s potential goes far beyond cryptocurrencies. From tracking supply chains to securing elections, blockchain is a paradigm shift in how data is stored, verified, and trusted. How Does Blockchain Actually Work? Think of blockchain like a shared Google Doc. Everyone has access, everyone can verify what’s been added, but no one can erase or rewrite history. Each block in the chain is a digital record that contains a bundle of data or transactions. These blocks are arranged chronologically, and every block references the hash (a unique identifier) of the previous one. This creates a secure chain where changing a single block would require altering all subsequent ones-a virtually impossible feat without immense computational power. Here’s a simplified step-by-step breakdown: A transaction is requested. The transaction is broadcast to a peer-to-peer network. The network validates the transaction using algorithms. Once verified, the transaction is bundled into a block. The new block is added to the existing blockchain. The transaction is complete and permanently recorded. This structure ensures security, transparency, and immutability, making blockchain ideal for environments where trust and accountability are paramount. Use Cases and Pilot Projects in Nepal Nepal is already experimenting with blockchain in exciting ways: Agriculture AgriClear : This platform uses blockchain to track products from farm to table. Consumers can scan QR codes to verify the origin of goods like Jumla apples, ensuring quality and traceability. Rural Development Digital Village Initiative (FAO) : Municipalities like Kalinchowk, Rong, and Chhinnamasta are piloting digital tools, including blockchain-powered systems and IoT-enabled irrigation, to boost agricultural productivity and climate resilience. Education Academic Credential Verification : Blockchain is being explored to issue tamper-proof digital certificates. This would simplify verification for employers and reduce fraud in academic qualifications. These initiatives underscore Nepal’s proactive approach to using blockchain for sustainable development. Challenges to Adoption Despite early progress, several hurdles remain: Digital Infrastructure : Many rural regions lack reliable internet access. Policy & Regulation : Nepal currently has unclear or restrictive policies on cryptocurrency and blockchain-related ventures. Awareness & Expertise : Blockchain is still new to most educators, policymakers, and the public. Addressing these issues is critical for broader implementation. The Synergy of AI and Blockchain Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two of the most transformative technologies of our time. While they come from different roots, blockchain being a decentralized ledger system and AI being a decision-making and data analysis engine, their integration opens up powerful possibilities. Here’s how AI and blockchain complement each other: 1. Transparent Data Source : Blockchain provides clean, traceable data that AI can trust for training and analysis. Every data entry on a blockchain is verifiable, making it a reliable foundation for AI models. 2. Autonomous Systems : Decentralized AI can be built using blockchain. Instead of relying on a single server, AI operations can be distributed across multiple nodes, promoting autonomy and reducing single points of failure. 3. Privacy Protection : Blockchain’s cryptographic foundations protect data privacy during AI training and operations. This makes it safer to work with sensitive data while maintaining model performance. 4. Distributed Computing Power : AI requires vast computing resources. Blockchain helps by pooling distributed systems, reducing hardware costs, and balancing energy loads. 5. Enhanced Security : Smart contracts on blockchains can have vulnerabilities. AI can detect and prevent exploitation by improving the logic and resilience of these contracts. 6. Improved Data Handling : AI improves the efficiency of reading and querying blockchain data. Techniques like the TTA-CB protocol combined with optimization algorithms can make data storage and retrieval faster. 7. Authenticity & Auditability : AI decisions can be hard to explain. Blockchain helps by keeping an immutable log of data, model changes, and decision steps, supporting explainable AI and trust in its outputs. 8. Augmentation : AI adds intelligence to blockchain-based systems. It can process large datasets quickly and offer actionable insights, enabling smart automation and model sharing across networks. 9. Automation : Smart contracts can use AI to make real-time decisions-for example, choosing the most efficient shipping method or resolving disputes automatically. Together, AI and blockchain can create decentralized AI systems that are more transparent, secure, and scalable. From protecting healthcare data to improving logistics and enabling smart governance, their synergy is already shaping the future. Education and Awareness in Nepal Blockchain is still a relatively new concept for many in nepal, but awareness is slowly starting to grow among people. While as I stated at the beginning of this blog that this technology is often misunderstood as just “crypto”. Educational efforts are beginning to clarify its real-world potential. Some institutions like Kathmandu University have started offering introductory sessions and short courses on blockchain. These just cover the basics, how blockchain works, its use cases, adn tools like Ethereum, Solana and smart contracts. However, such programs are still limited and are mostly available in few urban universities There’s currently no dedicated undergraduate or postgraduate programs focused solely on blockchain technology. Most students still learn about it informally, through youtube, online courses or developers forums. Community and Events Nepal’s blockchain ecosystem is rapidly evolving, driven by a collaborative network of organizations and communities dedicated to education, innovation, and secure digital transformation. eSatya eSatya is a leading blockchain initiative in Nepal, dedicated to advancing blockchain education and development. In January 2025, eSatya hosted the “Bringing Devcon to Kathmandu” event, sponsored by Devcon as part of its Satellite Events funding round. The event featured screenings of Ethereum Devcon keynotes and facilitated discussions on Ethereum’s global impact, aiming to inspire local developers and enthusiasts . Additionally, eSatya offers a 12-week Blockchain Fellowship Program, supported by the Ethereum Foundation’s Ecosystem Support Program. This mentor-led course equips participants with practical skills in blockchain development, including smart contract creation and decentralized application (DApp) development. In the 2023 cohort, 17 out of 22 fellows successfully completed the program and presented their projects, such as blockchain-based digital health records and decentralized finance applications. HimalAI HimalAI is an emerging tech community in Nepal that focuses on integrating blockchain with artificial intelligence. In April 2025, HimalAI organized a 48-hour AI/Web3 Hackathon at the HimalAI Hacker House near Tribhuvan University in Kirtipur. The event brought together developers, data scientists, and entrepreneurs to collaborate on innovative solutions leveraging the combined power of AI and blockchain technologies. Participants competed for NPR 100,000 in prizes and engaged in workshops and keynotes covering topics such as AI tools, Web3 applications, data collection, and model fine-tuning . The hackathon aimed to foster a collaborative environment for building real-world solutions and advancing the tech ecosystem in Nepal. Blockchain Foundation Nepal serves as a community-driven platform, bringing together blockchain enthusiasts, developers, and professionals through regular meetups and discussions to explore blockchain-based solutions and foster an active blockchain community in Nepal. CryptoGen Nepal , a cybersecurity firm, plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem by ensuring the security of blockchain applications and infrastructure. Their services include IS audits, vulnerability assessments, and incident response, helping safeguard blockchain platforms against potential threats. Nepal Internet Governance Forum (Nepal IGF) is a multi stakeholder platform that discusses internet governance issues, including the development and regulation of emerging technologies like blockchain. By bringing together government, private sector, civil society, and technical community representatives, Nepal IGF facilitates dialogues that shape the future of internet and blockchain policies in the country. Together, these organizations are cultivating a robust blockchain ecosystem in Nepal, promoting education, innovation, and secure implementation of blockchain technologies across various sectors. Challenges Despite these efforts, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption and understanding onr blockchain in Nepal: Limited Formal Education: Blockchain technology is not yet a standard part of academic curricula in most educational institutions. Misconceptions: There is prevalent confucsion between blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, leading to skepticism and hesitancy in embracing blockchain solutions. Resource constraints: Access to necessary resources, such as computing infrastructures and expert mentorship, is limited, particularly in rural areas Future Opportunities for Nepal Nepal can unlock tremendous value with blockchain in areas like: Voting Systems : Secure, transparent digital voting. Land Registries : Immutable, accessible property records. Disaster Relief : Transparent fund allocation during emergencies. Tourism : Blockchain-based tourist identity and insurance solutions. With proper policy and public-private partnerships, Nepal can become a blockchain innovation hub in South Asia. Conclusion Nepal is not too late to the blockchain revolution in fact, it may be just on time. By embracing this technology strategically, we can foster transparency, fight corruption, and empower citizens from the Himalayas to the Terai. Let us not wait for revolutions to happen. Let us build them, block by block. We are in a time when artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over our world, and its influence on the job market is generally taking a negative turn. You must have heard ominous statements: “AI is taking our jobs,” “Machines are making humans obsolete,” or “Automation means unemployment.” While such headlines are good clickbait material, they miss a fundamental point: AI isn’t so much eliminating jobs as it is transforming them. While it’s true that automation is revolutionizing the workforce, the idea that AI is taking human jobs overlooks a more subtle and hopeful reality. What’s really happening is that work roles are shifting, skills are evolving, and reskilling is the new norm. Instead of worrying about the rise of intelligent machines, we must prepare for a new era-one that appreciates flexibility, lifelong learning, and the unique value only humans can deliver. Let’s discuss AI, automation, and augmentation, and their differences. Understanding the Difference: Automation vs. Augmentation A popular myth is that AI will replace humans entirely. But AI doesn’t necessarily replace people in totality; it replaces tasks. To thoroughly understand the effect of AI on the job market, we need to differentiate between automation and augmentation. Automation implies the complete transfer of tasks from humans to machines. It is most certain to affect work that is repetitive, rule-based, and predictable-dare we say data entry, straightforward accounting, or routine factory work? Augmentation, on the contrary, is the utilization of artificial intelligence to enhance and supplement the capabilities of human workers. Decision-making, creativity, emotional intelligence, or strategic thinking is jobs that are less prone to be replaced and more apt to be augmented by AI. Take the field of medicine, for example. Radiologists are not being replaced by AI-they’re using it to read scans more quickly and accurately. Teachers are not being removed from the classroom-they’re using AI software to personalize lesson plans and cater to different learning styles. In most industries, AI is a collaborator, not an adversary. A widely-quoted McKinsey report estimates 60% of occupations have at least 30% of activities automated, and less than 5% of occupations are completely automated. That means the great majority of people won’t be losing their jobs to AI; rather, their jobs will change. Jobs at Risk, Jobs on the Rise. AI Behind? So, what are the real jobs in risk? It’s not so much jobs as a whole, but tasks within a job. Anything that entails hand-to-keyboard repetitive or mechanical procedures, it data entry clerks, telemarketers, or even parts of customer service-can be threatened by automation. Yet most other jobs are not just safe-they’re growing: AI/ML Engineers Data Scientists Cybersecurity Analysts Cloud Computing Specialists Digital Transformation Officers AI Ethics and Compliance Officers Even traditionally “low-tech” jobs are evolving. Marketing professionals, for example, now need to learn about data analytics. HR personnel are using AI tools for smarter hiring and employee retention strategies. What counts as “technical” is expanding, and hybrid roles that combine human and technical skills are in great demand. The Rise of Reskilling and Lifelong Learning One of the most profound changes AI is bringing to the workplace is the new focus on up-skilling and reskilling. Skills have an ever-shortening half-life. A skill learned five years ago might be obsolete today. The World Economic Forum estimates that 50% of all workers will need reskilling by 2025. How does this work out in practical life? Educational Digital Platforms Large web-based open course platforms like Coursera, DataCamp, edX, and Udemy are thriving. Individuals are gaining certificates in cloud computing, AI development, project management, and data analytics-let alone coding skills-within a few months or weeks. Corporate Reskilling Programs Leading companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM are investing heavily in internal upskilling programs. Amazon, to cite an excellent example, invested more than $700 million in reskilling 100,000 employees in emerging skills like machine learning and cloud computing. Public Sector Initiatives A few governments are also taking early action. Examples are Singapore’s SkillsFuture and Finland’s AI education program for all, which illustrate the role policy can play in enabling citizens to adjust to technological change. The key takeaway? Lifelong learning is no longer a luxury-it’s a necessity. Human Strengths in the Age of AI As computers get better at doing logical and computational tasks, those things that make us uniquely human are all the more valuable. AI can perhaps do complex equations and pattern recognition at scale-but it still cannot replicate emotional intelligence, creativity, critical thinking, and moral discernment. That’s where human beings continue to surpass: Creativity & Innovation: Though AI can produce text, it is impossible to generate ideas of cultural or emotional significance. The nursing care of a nurse who demonstrates empathy or the counseling provided by an exemplary teacher cannot be substituted by any system. Ethical Decision-Making: AI operates within defined parameters; it is not capable of solving ethical problems without human involvement. Contextual Understanding: Humans can comprehend subtleties, humor, sarcasm, and cultural references that machines fail to catch. The future of employment transcends the mere acquisition of coding skills; it encompasses the ability to coexist and collaborate with machines, while simultaneously emphasizing the qualities that render us uniquely human. Adaptability: The Ultimate Career Skill In the AI era, the single most valuable skill is not technical skill-it’s adaptability. The individuals who will thrive will be the ones who can change, learn new tools, and continue to adapt. To present a real-world example, one can look at the revolution taking place in the journalism sector. Initially, there were concerns that artificially generated news stories would displace human reporters. But the reality is far more complex. Journalists are now utilizing AI tools to rapidly produce first drafts, track public opinion, and identify emerging trends. Consequently, this technology enables them to devote more time to investigating journalism and deeper reporting. Similarly, customer service roles are changing. Chatbots handle FAQs, and human reps focus on high-empathy, high-complexity situations. In logistics, warehouse automation is creating roles for robotics supervisors and systems analysts. Goodbye to the ancient adage-specialize in one thing and that’s it for life. The new motto is: “Stay curious, stay flexible, stay learning.” A Global Perspective It’s also important to mention that AI impacts vary by geography. In wealthy nations, the uptake of AI is faster, but so are investments in digital infrastructure and re-skilling. In poorer nations, there’s more likelihood of job displacement without a safety net. Yet, global organizations are now turning their attention to inclusive AI development. The OECD, World Economic Forum, and UNESCO are championing AI policies that leave no one behind-especially women, minority communities, and employees in vulnerable industries. Final Thoughts: It’s Not AI vs. Humans-It’s AI with Humans The fear that artificial intelligence will “take our jobs” ignores the complexity of the changes that are underway. Yes, the character of work is changing, but this change does not mean the elimination of human labor. Rather, we are forced to rethink our identities, form new competencies, and envision a future in which technology enhances our abilities instead of replacing us. Instead of asking, “Will AI replace my job?” a more appropriate question is: How do I implement artificial intelligence to enhance my work performance? The future of work will not be man versus machine-it will be about co-creation, collaboration, and continuous growth. So, who is being replaced, then? Not the people. However, human activities refuse to move forward. Have you ever wondered how Instagram seems to know exactly what reel you’d like next, or how your phone can recognize your face even when you’re smiling? It’s like these things just get you very well and know you so much (are our data being leaked....😅). Well, the secret to that magic is something that we call machine learning. It’s a technology sneaking its way into almost all aspects of our lives without us even realizing it. From the suggestions we get on social media to how doctors diagnose disease, machine learning is making the world around us work its magic. But what the question is, how does it do that, and where else is it being used? Let me help you break it down simply. What is Machine Learning? At its core, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn. Using ML, your PC can learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task, from math to reasoning and identifying objects. Instead of telling specific instructions to your computer to follow, like running a Python script to find a derivative of a number, we provide it with examples and let it figure it out by itself without us telling it. Additionally, the machine will learn based on the patterns it detects and understand itself based on what pattern it represents. Let’s think of it this way: rather than telling a computer step-by-step how to find a cat in a photo, we show it thousands of cat pictures and let it discover the visual patterns that make a cat a cat like its ears, whiskers, tail, and pointy ears. The machine will not be able to identify it in one shot, but as we show it thousands of photos of cats continuously, over time, the machine will start to learn the common patterns in the photo and can pick out a cat in a new photo based on the pattern it learned. How is Machine Learning Different from Traditional Programming? Traditional programming follows a straightforward approach: Input + Rules → Output Machine learning flips this process: Input + Output → Rules We give the system inputs (data) and desired outputs, and it learns the rules to transform one into the other. This is powerful because it means the computer can handle tasks that would be impossibly complex to code explicitly. Types of Machine Learning There are three main types: 1. Supervised Learning In supervised learning, we provide examples that are labeled. The machine learns to associate some inputs with some outputs. For example, to develop a spam filter, we might input an algorithm with hundreds of emails that are classified as “spam” or “not spam.” The algorithm learns about the features that distinguish spam mail from good mail. 2. Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning occurs when a model is trained on data without labels. The algorithm tries to learn the patterns or clusters within the data itself. Unsupervised learning can be employed by a retailer who wants to group customers into different categories based on what they buy without knowing beforehand what these groups will be. 3. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is a method whereby an agent is trained to make decisions based on the feedback provided by the environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for actions and learns to maximize rewards with time. This is how AlphaGo was instructed to play the board game of Go at the superhuman level, and robots learn to travel through intricate spaces. This is the reason why beating a chess bot is so hard, as it was trained under reinforcement learning. The Machine Learning Process A typical machine learning project follows these steps: Collect Data: Gather relevant data for your problem. Prepare Data: Clean and format the data so it’s usable. Choose a model: Select an appropriate algorithm for your task. Train the Model: Feed your data to the algorithm so it can learn patterns. Evaluate the Model: Test how well your model performs. Tune Parameters: Adjust settings so that they can improve performance. Make Predictions: Use your trained model on new data. Real-World Applications Machine learning powers many technologies we use daily: Virtual Assistants: Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use machine learning to understand and respond to voice commands. Recommendation Systems: Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon suggest content based on your preferences. Email Filtering: Gmail automatically sorts emails into primary, social, and promotional categories. Medical Diagnosis: Algorithms help doctors detect diseases from medical images. Fraud Detection: Banks use machine learning to identify suspicious transactions. Challenges in Machine Learning Despite its power, machine learning faces several challenges: Data Quality: Models are only as good as the data they’re trained on. Bias: If training data contains biases, the model will likely perpetuate them. Explainability: Complex models often function as “black boxes,” making it difficult to understand how they reach specific conclusions. Privacy Concerns: often requires large amounts of data, raising questions about data privacy. Getting Started with Machine Learning So now, if you’re interested in learning more about machine learning, here are some steps to get started: Learn the Basics: Understand fundamental concepts like algorithms, models, and evaluation metrics like how will your machine learn an image or predict, learn what models are there to train a machine learning model, and how to know if your machine is learning instead of mugging up everything. Study Statistics and Probability: These are the mathematical foundations of machine learning. Yup, math is needed to understand the algorithm I said too, so yes it is very important and we cannot skip this. Pick a Programming Language: Python is the most popular choice for machine learning due to its simplicity and robust libraries. Try Simple Projects: Start with beginner-friendly problems like predicting house prices or classifying images. You can use Kaggle to learn and do projects. Conclusion Machine learning is redefining how we solve issues in industries. By allowing computers to learn from data, we can solve complex problems that would be impossible with traditional programming techniques. The field is developing extremely rapidly, with new methods and applications consistently being discovered. If you’d like to integrate machine learning into your business or are considering doing so as a career, gaining an understanding of the fundamentals is the first step toward tapping its potential. As we advance into the future, machine learning will forever change our world in many exciting ways, making now a great time to dive into this cutting-edge technology. Introduction: In the world of computers and the internet, most people compete with Mac and Windows, just like comparing iOS and Android not knowing there is something known as Linux. If you are a tech student or one into computers, you might have heard about Linux somewhere. If you’re new to Linux and want to understand why it’s gaining popularity, then this guide, “Linux for Beginners” is for you. Linux is a powerful, secure, and open-source operating system that has become a viable alternative to Windows and macOS. Whether you’re a student, developer, or casual user, Linux offers flexibility and customization to suit your needs. But where have you used it is the question. Those who have not used Linux or maybe have heard it for the first time should know why it is one of the greatest fields to explore. And if you think that it has a great field then why is it not being known as an alternative to Windows and ios, well in reality Linux is used more than these actually, the majority of the world’s cloud computing servers are Linux based. It is a dominating OS for web servers, database servers, and other applications that power the majority of internet services. It is also used in embedded systems like smartwatches, Bluetooth speakers, thermostats cars, and many more. The Android that the majority of you talk about is based on Linux itself, not just that more than 500 computers are using Linux as their operating system, and hackers or expert programmers prefer Linux compared to other OS. So the question arises should we switch to Linux? Should we switch to Linux? We just talked about Linux being used by hackers and developers, not just that I also told you guys about Linux being used in the supercomputer so it means Linux is really fast and cool right? Well not exactly. The majority of Linux is perceived faster because there is no such bloatware like Windows and is lightweight compared to MacOS, so the majority of tasks might feel better in performance compared to other OS but this will depend on your system. I told you about the system cause Linux runs on almost anything and I mean it. Let me tell you more about its advantages. Reasons to Choose Linux Security and Privacy Unlike Mac and Windows, Linux is far secure with strong security features such as no such things as forced updates which are the most irritating things in the majority of OS, and no bloatware and spyware. Unlike other OS, Linux does not track its users and try to fetch their user data, Linux instead provides you full control over the system and lets you decide what to do. One fun thing about is that the majority of viruses in the world are designed for either Windows or MacOS so by default there are very less viruses ever designed that work on Linux making it more secure Open Source and Free: I just told you about how Linux gives us whole control and is transparent to us and this is what developers love about it and thus call it Open source as we can get to know how it was made and how to configure it all on the internet and all for free. So instead of paying for licenses for OS like Windows and macOS, we can just get Linux for free. Just being free makes this a great choice for students and budget-conscious users Performance and Efficiency I talked about hardware to you and why I brought it was because Linux can run on almost all hardware, Linux is lightweight and optimized for performance making it a great choice to revive your old laptop that becomes buggy and slow due to Windows. Just install Linux and feel it as if it’s new. Things to remember before Downloading Linux as a beginner to Linux Hardware Compatibility: Personally, when I downloaded Linux on old hardware there were no such issues like this but when I switched to new-gen laptops a lot of problems arose such as hardware not supporting, divrives not responding and the keyboard not functioning. These are common in Linux as the Linux you download is not fully built according to your laptop but in general consideration of what a simple device looks, so as you get more new gen computer you need to switch to better Linux or download all the hardware and drivers to the current Linux which might be quite hard for new users. Software compatibility: Not just hardware and drivers, so many software are not compatible with Linux too for instance majority of editing software like MS Office, Adobe Platform, and more are not available in Linux normally, we need to hardcode and download them from a third, and still it may not support fully.

{"id": "sunway_75", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/category/blog/", "title": "No Title", "content": "Blog Archives - Sunway College Kathmandu The farming world has always been at the mercy of nature. While farming has seen impressive success through modern practices in improving yield, pest control, and weather management, one constant threat always lingers over agriculture: crop disease. Whether rust in wheat, blight in potato, or mildew in grape, crop disease has long been a thorn in the flesh for farmers. Crop diseases can completely destroy harvests, wiping out small-scale and large-scale farms equally. But what if we could predict crop diseases before they are an issue, allowing farmers to respond to the very first indications that something is amiss. That’s where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in. With the incorporation of advanced machine learning algorithms, image recognition, and real-time data, AI is turning farmers into disease detectives-identifying potential problems well ahead of time before they get out of hand. Let us take a closer look at how AI is revolutionizing the prediction, control, and prevention of crop disease. The Challenge of Crop Diseases Before explaining how AI helps, one needs to understand the scope and magnitude of crop disease. Crop disease is the cause of an astronomical amount of loss of food worldwide annually. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates plant diseases as being to blame for as much as 40% of global crop loss-loss that translates to direct crop damage and cost of pesticides and disease control. Farmers usually rely on a combination of visual inspections, expert judgment, and weather forecasts to predict and manage diseases. But these controls are usually too late or are not specific enough. Diseases are apt to become uncontrollable fast, especially in large fields, and by the time they have been detected, it is too late to avert the harm. Traditional Methods of Disease Detection The ways of detecting crop diseases in the past were fairly primitive: Expert or farmer visual inspections that can easily miss early signs. Field sampling wherein parts of crops are being sent to labs to be analyzed, a slow process that may or may not deliver real-time feedback. Weather predictions, used to identify conditions (rain, temperature, humidity) favorable to disease epidemics, but without information on whether or not a crop in a specific region is indeed infected. These techniques are not as proactive but are rather reactive, and they are normally infested with human elements, lapses in time, and the sheer magnitude of modern-day farms. AI: The Disease Detective Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML), introduces a revolutionized approach to the problem of crop diseases. Machine learning is a branch of AI that enables systems to learn from experience, become more intelligent with time, and take decisions autonomously with minimal human intervention. It can be utilized in agriculture to recognize patterns, predict future events, and generate implementable outcomes. This is how AI is transforming the prediction of crop diseases: 1. Image Recognition for Early Disease Detection One of the most powerful uses of AI in agriculture is image recognition. Crops are captured in high-resolution photos by drones, satellites, and even hand-held cameras. The photos are fed into AI algorithms that have been programmed to see even the smallest indication of disease-often before the human eye can do so. For example: Leaf spots, a first indication of disease, may be identified in an image by machine learning algorithms that have been trained to recognize patterns in leaf shape, texture, and color. Innovative machine learning algorithms can even identify discoloration or wilting symptoms of infection caused by fungi or bacteria through images of the plant. The beauty is that this process can be scaled up. AI can cut through thousands of images from drones or satellite imagery to detect possible outbreaks in real-time, thus allowing early intervention. 2. Predictive Analytics for Disease Forecasting It can also predict the outbreak of disease by analyzing huge ranges of data points. It does not just look for observable clues, but accounts for other variables like: Weather conditions-temperature, rainfall, humidity Soil conditions Crop type and variety Disease history data AI could then present a probability calculation of the occurrence of specific diseases in specific regions, depending on environmental factors and existing patterns from previous seasons. As an illustration, if an AI system detects a high-humidity, high-temperature scenario-ideal for fungal growth-it can initiate farmers to adopt preventive actions like the application of fungicides, adjustment of irrigation schedule, or inspection of vulnerable crop zones. 3. Machine Learning for Continuous Improvement Machine learning programs improve over time. With each new set of data, AI is more and more able to make accurate disease predictions. The more it looks at pictures and the more it consumes from the world around it, the more it will see pre-symptomatic indicators of crop disease. For instance, the deep learning models are usually applied to identify and classify diseases based on plant images. The model continuously learns from the feedback it receives. If the farmer identifies a disease (or not) correctly (or wrongly), the AI platform refines its idea of the disease and improves the predictions. 4. Integration with Internet of Things (IoT) Devices AI predictability is also enhanced when merged with IoT devices on the farm. IoT devices are able to monitor environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real time. When merged with drone or satellite data, the real-time information stream gives the AI system the context of each crop, which makes the disease predictions even more precise. For example, the soil sensors may register low nitrogen levels, a stress factor that can predispose crops to disease infection. The AI system may suggest a specific remedy, for example, the application of fertilizers to boost the plants’ health. Benefits of Using AI for Disease Prediction The impact of using AI for forecasting crop disease is gigantic. Let us consider the most important advantages: 1. Preemptive Disease Management The strongest attribute of AI in the prediction of diseases is to act before a disease becomes entrenched. The traditional way is to react after diseases begin to spread. In contrast, AI allows farmers to catch problems early, at a stage when they can still avoid massive damage. 2. Targeted Interventions Through the application of AI, farmers will be in a position to make more fact-based, informed choices. Instead of spraying fungicides or pesticides over an entire field, AI will determine where the disease is most likely to appear. This makes for better-targeted use of chemicals, saving cash and cutting back on environmental damage. 3. Higher Yield and Lower Losses Disease detection with AI leads to healthier plants and ultimately higher yields. Because the farmers are able to prevent the worst of the disease, they are less likely to incur crushing crop loss, which translates into greater profitability. 4. Cost Savings Prevention of an outbreak of disease is far less expensive than addressing its effects. By accurate prediction of where and when a disease will appear, farmers do not waste money on treatments that are expensive, labor, and replanting. 5. Sustainability Disease forecasting using AI renders agriculture more sustainable by reducing the reliance on high pesticide application and soil fertility. It not only reduces the environmental footprint of agriculture, but also the risk of chemical resistance in pests and diseases is minimized. Real-World Examples of AI in Crop Disease Prediction Plantix (Germany) Plantix, a mobile application for plant health, uses AI and image recognition to help farmers diagnose crop diseases. Farmers take a photo of their plants, and the AI checks the image for disease, pest, or nutrient deficiency. The app then recommends treatment and connects farmers with experts. IBM Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture IBM’s platform uses AI, weather information, and block-chain to allow farmers to foresee and plan against diseases. The platform’s AI uses historical and real-time data and provides predictions on crop health along with recommending specific actions for disease prevention. Crop sensor (USA) Crop sensor uses AI-powered drones and sensors to monitor the health of the crops. AI algorithms analyze the data and predict the likely eruption of diseases and give farmers an early beginning for disease control. The Future of AI in Crop Disease Prediction The future of AI in crop disease prediction looks incredibly promising. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more powerful tools for disease prevention, including: Real-time drone surveillance with AI analysis on the go. More sophisticated weather models predicting disease risks. Automated disease management systems, where AI directly controls drones or sprayers to apply treatments only where needed. The intersection of AI and agriculture isn’t just about making farming more efficient; it’s about saving the planet’s food supply, one smart prediction at a time. Conclusion Artificial Intelligence is transforming crop disease management for farmers by delivering solutions that not only warn when the disease will strike, but also pre-empt its occurrence in the first place. Through predictive analytics, machine learning, and pre-emptive warning, farmers today are more empowered than ever to safeguard their crops, reduce waste, and enhance yield. With advancements in this technology along the lines they’re currently headed, there’s no question that AI will be a part of the future of agriculture-helping us feed more people on this planet more sustainably and efficiently. Agriculturists do not need to wait for the diseases to manifest themselves before acting. With AI, they are able to get ahead and keep their crops-and their businesses-disease-free in the next few years. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept; it’s a global force reshaping industries, economies, and daily life. From optimizing complex systems to personalizing user experiences, AI’s potential is undeniable. Like many nations, Nepal is awakening to this transformative power and grappling with how best to harness it for national development while mitigating potential risks. The recent unveiling of the draft National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy 2081 (corresponding to 2025 AD) signals a significant step in this direction. But is this initial stride enough? This post delves into the current state of AI policy in Nepal. Similarly, identifies crucial missing pieces. Also, explores the necessary next steps to build a robust and beneficial AI ecosystem for the nation, and also speaks about Nepal’s AI policy. The Current Landscape: Nepal’s Initial Steps into AI Governance Nepal’s journey towards formal AI governance isn’t starting from scratch. The Digital Nepal Framework 2076 (2019 AD) laid some groundwork, emphasizing AI, big data, and cloud computing. It worked as a key technological pillar for the nation’s digital transformation. Building on this, the draft National AI Policy 2081, released for public consultation by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MoCIT) in early 2025, marks a dedicated effort to create a strategic framework for AI. Key Highlights of the Draft Policy: Visionary Goals: The policy sets a vision for AI-driven digital transformation, aiming to integrate AI into key economic and social sectors like agriculture, healthcare, tourism, education, and governance to boost productivity and align with national development goals. Institutional Framework: It proposes creating new bodies to guide and regulate AI: National AI Center: To serve as the primary regulatory body overseeing AI growth, usage, and research. AI Regulation Council: Headed by the MoCIT Minister, focusing on ethical oversight, ensuring AI benefits society while respecting human rights and privacy, and aligning with international standards. AI Excellence Centers: To be established in universities and research institutions at national and provincial levels to foster R&D, focusing on ethical data handling and priority sectors. Infrastructure and Ethics: The policy acknowledges the need for expanding digital infrastructure (like 5G, fiber optics, data centers, cloud services) and places a strong emphasis on ethical AI development and regulation. While government-led initiatives are nascent, Nepal’s private sector shows glimpses of AI adoption. Startups like Fuse machines Nepal and Paaila Technology are working on AI-driven solutions in areas like chatbots, automation, and data analytics, particularly in finance, e-commerce, and potentially healthcare. However, this growth remains somewhat limited, often happening in pockets rather than as part of a coordinated national strategy. Identifying the Gaps: What’s Missing in Nepal’s AI Policy Strategy? Despite the commendable intentions laid out in the draft policy, several critical gaps and challenges need addressing for Nepal to effectively leverage AI. 1. The Implementation Chasm : The draft policy outlines ambitious goals but according to analysis, lacks a concrete roadmap. Crucial details regarding responsible agencies, specific funding mechanisms, timelines, and measurable outcomes are missing. Without these, there’s a significant risk of the policy remaining largely aspirational, confined to paper rather than practice. 2. Foundational Weaknesses: Infrastructure & Data: AI thrives on data and robust infrastructure. Nepal faces significant hurdles here: Infrastructure Deficit: Limited high-speed internet penetration, unreliable electricity supply, and inadequate access to advanced computing power and data centers severely restrict AI development and deployment. Data Governance: While the policy mentions data, it needs more explicit policies on data governance, including data quality standards, cleansing, security protocols, privacy protection, and clear regulations for cross-border data sharing. 3. The R&D and Skills Deficit: Meaningful AI development requires strong research capabilities and a skilled workforce. Underfunded R&D: Nepal invests less than 1% of its GDP in research and development, leaving institutions under-resourced. The draft policy encourages university collaboration and research centers, but without a clear financing strategy for AI labs and R&D hubs, Nepal may remain dependent on foreign technology. Talent Gap & Awareness: There’s a recognized shortage of AI professionals and low AI literacy among the broader population. Building a skilled workforce through dedicated educational programs and raising public awareness are critical yet underdeveloped areas. 4. Regulatory Vagueness and Ethical Implementation: While the draft mentions ethics and proposes a council, the governance section needs more teeth. Clearer guidelines are needed on transparency, accountability, bias mitigation, cybersecurity standards, data privacy enforcement (beyond just confidentiality, integrity, availability), and preventing misuse for surveillance or disinformation. The policy needs a well-defined, applicable definition of AI and a comprehensive glossary. 5. Stimulating the Ecosystem : The policy mentions public-private partnerships (PPPs) but lacks concrete details on incentives to encourage private sector investment and AI entrepreneurship. Tax breaks, startup grants, venture capital matching schemes, and dedicated innovation hubs are needed to catalyze the ecosystem, like approaches in countries like India or Singapore. 6. Localization Lag : For AI to be truly inclusive and effective across Nepal, solutions need to be developed and adapted for Nepali and other regional languages and contexts. Charting the Path Forward: What’s Next for Nepal’s AI Policy? Addressing these gaps requires a concerted and strategic effort. The following steps are crucial for Nepal’s AI journey: 1. Finalize and Operationalize the Policy : Incorporate stakeholder feedback (including recommendations from bodies like the CAN Federation) into the draft policy. Most importantly, translate the finalized policy into a clear, actionable, and funded implementation plan with defined roles, responsibilities, and timelines. 2. Build the Bedrock Infrastructure First: Prioritize substantial investment in core digital infrastructure: reliable power, nationwide high-speed internet, and secure, state-of-the-art data centers and cloud capabilities. This is non-negotiable for any serious AI ambition. 3. Invest in People and Ideas: Dramatically increase funding for AI research and development. Establish and adequately resource the proposed AI Excellence Centers. Integrate AI into university curricula, offer scholarships, and launch nationwide AI literacy and upskilling programs. 4. Develop Robust Legal & Ethical Guardrails : Craft clear, specific, and enforceable regulations covering data protection, cybersecurity, ethical AI principles (fairness, transparency, accountability), and responsible AI use. Ensure these legal frameworks protect citizens’ rights while fostering innovation. 5. Catalyze Collaboration and Investment: Design and implement attractive incentives for private sector AI development, startups, and PPPs. Foster a collaborative environment between government, academia, industry, and civil society. Explore strategic international partnerships, potentially learning from models like the Singapore-Rwanda AI Playbook for resource pooling. 6. Prioritize Localization and Sectoral Impact: Actively support the development of AI tools tailored to Nepal’s linguistic and cultural diversity. Continue focusing AI applications on key sectors (agriculture, health, education, disaster management) where they can deliver maximum societal and economic benefits. Artificial Intelligence holds immense potential to accelerate Nepal’s development, enhance public services, and create new economic opportunities. The draft National AI Policy 2081 is a vital first step, signaling the government’s commitment. However, a policy document alone is insufficient. Real work lies ahead: bridging the gap between ambition and action. This requires moving beyond broad statements to concrete implementation plans. Additionally, securing dedicated funding, building foundational infrastructure, nurturing local talent, establishing clear ethical and legal frameworks, and fostering a vibrant ecosystem through collaboration and smart incentives. By addressing the missing pieces and strategically charting the next steps, Nepal can harness the power of AI. It can harness not just to keep pace with the world, but to build a more prosperous and inclusive future. Also, it can harness a resilient future for all its citizens. The journey requires a collective effort, and the government should unite the industry, academia, and the public. It should unite towards a shared vision of responsible and impactful AI development. Introduction: Why Blockchain, Why Now? As the world moves forward with new technologies, Nepal isn’t staying too far behind. We’re seeing more people talk about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning every day, and slowly but surely, Nepal is adopting them too. But here’s something you don’t hear as often-what about blockchain? Why isn’t blockchain getting the same attention in Nepal? Is it just because cryptocurrency is banned here? In this blog, I want to explore the potential of blockchain in Nepal-beyond just crypto. We’ll look at how it works, what’s already happening, and why it could be a game-changer for our country. So, here’s the big question: Is blockchain the tool that can help Nepal grow stronger, smarter, and fairer? What is Blockchain, Really? At a glance, blockchain is an application of Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT). At its core, it’s a digital ledger-a secure, decentralized system that records transactions across a network of computers. Unlike traditional databases controlled by central authorities, blockchain is transparent, tamper-resistant, and maintained collectively by its participants. Though Bitcoin popularized the term, blockchain technology’s potential goes far beyond cryptocurrencies. From tracking supply chains to securing elections, blockchain is a paradigm shift in how data is stored, verified, and trusted. How Does Blockchain Actually Work? Think of blockchain like a shared Google Doc. Everyone has access, everyone can verify what’s been added, but no one can erase or rewrite history. Each block in the chain is a digital record that contains a bundle of data or transactions. These blocks are arranged chronologically, and every block references the hash (a unique identifier) of the previous one. This creates a secure chain where changing a single block would require altering all subsequent ones-a virtually impossible feat without immense computational power. Here’s a simplified step-by-step breakdown: A transaction is requested. The transaction is broadcast to a peer-to-peer network. The network validates the transaction using algorithms. Once verified, the transaction is bundled into a block. The new block is added to the existing blockchain. The transaction is complete and permanently recorded. This structure ensures security, transparency, and immutability, making blockchain ideal for environments where trust and accountability are paramount. Use Cases and Pilot Projects in Nepal Nepal is already experimenting with blockchain in exciting ways: Agriculture AgriClear : This platform uses blockchain to track products from farm to table. Consumers can scan QR codes to verify the origin of goods like Jumla apples, ensuring quality and traceability. Rural Development Digital Village Initiative (FAO) : Municipalities like Kalinchowk, Rong, and Chhinnamasta are piloting digital tools, including blockchain-powered systems and IoT-enabled irrigation, to boost agricultural productivity and climate resilience. Education Academic Credential Verification : Blockchain is being explored to issue tamper-proof digital certificates. This would simplify verification for employers and reduce fraud in academic qualifications. These initiatives underscore Nepal’s proactive approach to using blockchain for sustainable development. Challenges to Adoption Despite early progress, several hurdles remain: Digital Infrastructure : Many rural regions lack reliable internet access. Policy & Regulation : Nepal currently has unclear or restrictive policies on cryptocurrency and blockchain-related ventures. Awareness & Expertise : Blockchain is still new to most educators, policymakers, and the public. Addressing these issues is critical for broader implementation. The Synergy of AI and Blockchain Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two of the most transformative technologies of our time. While they come from different roots, blockchain being a decentralized ledger system and AI being a decision-making and data analysis engine, their integration opens up powerful possibilities. Here’s how AI and blockchain complement each other: 1. Transparent Data Source : Blockchain provides clean, traceable data that AI can trust for training and analysis. Every data entry on a blockchain is verifiable, making it a reliable foundation for AI models. 2. Autonomous Systems : Decentralized AI can be built using blockchain. Instead of relying on a single server, AI operations can be distributed across multiple nodes, promoting autonomy and reducing single points of failure. 3. Privacy Protection : Blockchain’s cryptographic foundations protect data privacy during AI training and operations. This makes it safer to work with sensitive data while maintaining model performance. 4. Distributed Computing Power : AI requires vast computing resources. Blockchain helps by pooling distributed systems, reducing hardware costs, and balancing energy loads. 5. Enhanced Security : Smart contracts on blockchains can have vulnerabilities. AI can detect and prevent exploitation by improving the logic and resilience of these contracts. 6. Improved Data Handling : AI improves the efficiency of reading and querying blockchain data. Techniques like the TTA-CB protocol combined with optimization algorithms can make data storage and retrieval faster. 7. Authenticity & Auditability : AI decisions can be hard to explain. Blockchain helps by keeping an immutable log of data, model changes, and decision steps, supporting explainable AI and trust in its outputs. 8. Augmentation : AI adds intelligence to blockchain-based systems. It can process large datasets quickly and offer actionable insights, enabling smart automation and model sharing across networks. 9. Automation : Smart contracts can use AI to make real-time decisions-for example, choosing the most efficient shipping method or resolving disputes automatically. Together, AI and blockchain can create decentralized AI systems that are more transparent, secure, and scalable. From protecting healthcare data to improving logistics and enabling smart governance, their synergy is already shaping the future. Education and Awareness in Nepal Blockchain is still a relatively new concept for many in nepal, but awareness is slowly starting to grow among people. While as I stated at the beginning of this blog that this technology is often misunderstood as just “crypto”. Educational efforts are beginning to clarify its real-world potential. Some institutions like Kathmandu University have started offering introductory sessions and short courses on blockchain. These just cover the basics, how blockchain works, its use cases, adn tools like Ethereum, Solana and smart contracts. However, such programs are still limited and are mostly available in few urban universities There’s currently no dedicated undergraduate or postgraduate programs focused solely on blockchain technology. Most students still learn about it informally, through youtube, online courses or developers forums. Community and Events Nepal’s blockchain ecosystem is rapidly evolving, driven by a collaborative network of organizations and communities dedicated to education, innovation, and secure digital transformation. eSatya eSatya is a leading blockchain initiative in Nepal, dedicated to advancing blockchain education and development. In January 2025, eSatya hosted the “Bringing Devcon to Kathmandu” event, sponsored by Devcon as part of its Satellite Events funding round. The event featured screenings of Ethereum Devcon keynotes and facilitated discussions on Ethereum’s global impact, aiming to inspire local developers and enthusiasts . Additionally, eSatya offers a 12-week Blockchain Fellowship Program, supported by the Ethereum Foundation’s Ecosystem Support Program. This mentor-led course equips participants with practical skills in blockchain development, including smart contract creation and decentralized application (DApp) development. In the 2023 cohort, 17 out of 22 fellows successfully completed the program and presented their projects, such as blockchain-based digital health records and decentralized finance applications. HimalAI HimalAI is an emerging tech community in Nepal that focuses on integrating blockchain with artificial intelligence. In April 2025, HimalAI organized a 48-hour AI/Web3 Hackathon at the HimalAI Hacker House near Tribhuvan University in Kirtipur. The event brought together developers, data scientists, and entrepreneurs to collaborate on innovative solutions leveraging the combined power of AI and blockchain technologies. Participants competed for NPR 100,000 in prizes and engaged in workshops and keynotes covering topics such as AI tools, Web3 applications, data collection, and model fine-tuning . The hackathon aimed to foster a collaborative environment for building real-world solutions and advancing the tech ecosystem in Nepal. Blockchain Foundation Nepal serves as a community-driven platform, bringing together blockchain enthusiasts, developers, and professionals through regular meetups and discussions to explore blockchain-based solutions and foster an active blockchain community in Nepal. CryptoGen Nepal , a cybersecurity firm, plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem by ensuring the security of blockchain applications and infrastructure. Their services include IS audits, vulnerability assessments, and incident response, helping safeguard blockchain platforms against potential threats. Nepal Internet Governance Forum (Nepal IGF) is a multi stakeholder platform that discusses internet governance issues, including the development and regulation of emerging technologies like blockchain. By bringing together government, private sector, civil society, and technical community representatives, Nepal IGF facilitates dialogues that shape the future of internet and blockchain policies in the country. Together, these organizations are cultivating a robust blockchain ecosystem in Nepal, promoting education, innovation, and secure implementation of blockchain technologies across various sectors. Challenges Despite these efforts, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption and understanding onr blockchain in Nepal: Limited Formal Education: Blockchain technology is not yet a standard part of academic curricula in most educational institutions. Misconceptions: There is prevalent confucsion between blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, leading to skepticism and hesitancy in embracing blockchain solutions. Resource constraints: Access to necessary resources, such as computing infrastructures and expert mentorship, is limited, particularly in rural areas Future Opportunities for Nepal Nepal can unlock tremendous value with blockchain in areas like: Voting Systems : Secure, transparent digital voting. Land Registries : Immutable, accessible property records. Disaster Relief : Transparent fund allocation during emergencies. Tourism : Blockchain-based tourist identity and insurance solutions. With proper policy and public-private partnerships, Nepal can become a blockchain innovation hub in South Asia. Conclusion Nepal is not too late to the blockchain revolution in fact, it may be just on time. By embracing this technology strategically, we can foster transparency, fight corruption, and empower citizens from the Himalayas to the Terai. Let us not wait for revolutions to happen. Let us build them, block by block. We are in a time when artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over our world, and its influence on the job market is generally taking a negative turn. You must have heard ominous statements: “AI is taking our jobs,” “Machines are making humans obsolete,” or “Automation means unemployment.” While such headlines are good clickbait material, they miss a fundamental point: AI isn’t so much eliminating jobs as it is transforming them. While it’s true that automation is revolutionizing the workforce, the idea that AI is taking human jobs overlooks a more subtle and hopeful reality. What’s really happening is that work roles are shifting, skills are evolving, and reskilling is the new norm. Instead of worrying about the rise of intelligent machines, we must prepare for a new era-one that appreciates flexibility, lifelong learning, and the unique value only humans can deliver. Let’s discuss AI, automation, and augmentation, and their differences. Understanding the Difference: Automation vs. Augmentation A popular myth is that AI will replace humans entirely. But AI doesn’t necessarily replace people in totality; it replaces tasks. To thoroughly understand the effect of AI on the job market, we need to differentiate between automation and augmentation. Automation implies the complete transfer of tasks from humans to machines. It is most certain to affect work that is repetitive, rule-based, and predictable-dare we say data entry, straightforward accounting, or routine factory work? Augmentation, on the contrary, is the utilization of artificial intelligence to enhance and supplement the capabilities of human workers. Decision-making, creativity, emotional intelligence, or strategic thinking is jobs that are less prone to be replaced and more apt to be augmented by AI. Take the field of medicine, for example. Radiologists are not being replaced by AI-they’re using it to read scans more quickly and accurately. Teachers are not being removed from the classroom-they’re using AI software to personalize lesson plans and cater to different learning styles. In most industries, AI is a collaborator, not an adversary. A widely-quoted McKinsey report estimates 60% of occupations have at least 30% of activities automated, and less than 5% of occupations are completely automated. That means the great majority of people won’t be losing their jobs to AI; rather, their jobs will change. Jobs at Risk, Jobs on the Rise. AI Behind? So, what are the real jobs in risk? It’s not so much jobs as a whole, but tasks within a job. Anything that entails hand-to-keyboard repetitive or mechanical procedures, it data entry clerks, telemarketers, or even parts of customer service-can be threatened by automation. Yet most other jobs are not just safe-they’re growing: AI/ML Engineers Data Scientists Cybersecurity Analysts Cloud Computing Specialists Digital Transformation Officers AI Ethics and Compliance Officers Even traditionally “low-tech” jobs are evolving. Marketing professionals, for example, now need to learn about data analytics. HR personnel are using AI tools for smarter hiring and employee retention strategies. What counts as “technical” is expanding, and hybrid roles that combine human and technical skills are in great demand. The Rise of Reskilling and Lifelong Learning One of the most profound changes AI is bringing to the workplace is the new focus on up-skilling and reskilling. Skills have an ever-shortening half-life. A skill learned five years ago might be obsolete today. The World Economic Forum estimates that 50% of all workers will need reskilling by 2025. How does this work out in practical life? Educational Digital Platforms Large web-based open course platforms like Coursera, DataCamp, edX, and Udemy are thriving. Individuals are gaining certificates in cloud computing, AI development, project management, and data analytics-let alone coding skills-within a few months or weeks. Corporate Reskilling Programs Leading companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM are investing heavily in internal upskilling programs. Amazon, to cite an excellent example, invested more than $700 million in reskilling 100,000 employees in emerging skills like machine learning and cloud computing. Public Sector Initiatives A few governments are also taking early action. Examples are Singapore’s SkillsFuture and Finland’s AI education program for all, which illustrate the role policy can play in enabling citizens to adjust to technological change. The key takeaway? Lifelong learning is no longer a luxury-it’s a necessity. Human Strengths in the Age of AI As computers get better at doing logical and computational tasks, those things that make us uniquely human are all the more valuable. AI can perhaps do complex equations and pattern recognition at scale-but it still cannot replicate emotional intelligence, creativity, critical thinking, and moral discernment. That’s where human beings continue to surpass: Creativity & Innovation: Though AI can produce text, it is impossible to generate ideas of cultural or emotional significance. The nursing care of a nurse who demonstrates empathy or the counseling provided by an exemplary teacher cannot be substituted by any system. Ethical Decision-Making: AI operates within defined parameters; it is not capable of solving ethical problems without human involvement. Contextual Understanding: Humans can comprehend subtleties, humor, sarcasm, and cultural references that machines fail to catch. The future of employment transcends the mere acquisition of coding skills; it encompasses the ability to coexist and collaborate with machines, while simultaneously emphasizing the qualities that render us uniquely human. Adaptability: The Ultimate Career Skill In the AI era, the single most valuable skill is not technical skill-it’s adaptability. The individuals who will thrive will be the ones who can change, learn new tools, and continue to adapt. To present a real-world example, one can look at the revolution taking place in the journalism sector. Initially, there were concerns that artificially generated news stories would displace human reporters. But the reality is far more complex. Journalists are now utilizing AI tools to rapidly produce first drafts, track public opinion, and identify emerging trends. Consequently, this technology enables them to devote more time to investigating journalism and deeper reporting. Similarly, customer service roles are changing. Chatbots handle FAQs, and human reps focus on high-empathy, high-complexity situations. In logistics, warehouse automation is creating roles for robotics supervisors and systems analysts. Goodbye to the ancient adage-specialize in one thing and that’s it for life. The new motto is: “Stay curious, stay flexible, stay learning.” A Global Perspective It’s also important to mention that AI impacts vary by geography. In wealthy nations, the uptake of AI is faster, but so are investments in digital infrastructure and re-skilling. In poorer nations, there’s more likelihood of job displacement without a safety net. Yet, global organizations are now turning their attention to inclusive AI development. The OECD, World Economic Forum, and UNESCO are championing AI policies that leave no one behind-especially women, minority communities, and employees in vulnerable industries. Final Thoughts: It’s Not AI vs. Humans-It’s AI with Humans The fear that artificial intelligence will “take our jobs” ignores the complexity of the changes that are underway. Yes, the character of work is changing, but this change does not mean the elimination of human labor. Rather, we are forced to rethink our identities, form new competencies, and envision a future in which technology enhances our abilities instead of replacing us. Instead of asking, “Will AI replace my job?” a more appropriate question is: How do I implement artificial intelligence to enhance my work performance? The future of work will not be man versus machine-it will be about co-creation, collaboration, and continuous growth. So, who is being replaced, then? Not the people. However, human activities refuse to move forward. Have you ever wondered how Instagram seems to know exactly what reel you’d like next, or how your phone can recognize your face even when you’re smiling? It’s like these things just get you very well and know you so much (are our data being leaked....😅). Well, the secret to that magic is something that we call machine learning. It’s a technology sneaking its way into almost all aspects of our lives without us even realizing it. From the suggestions we get on social media to how doctors diagnose disease, machine learning is making the world around us work its magic. But what the question is, how does it do that, and where else is it being used? Let me help you break it down simply. What is Machine Learning? At its core, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn. Using ML, your PC can learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task, from math to reasoning and identifying objects. Instead of telling specific instructions to your computer to follow, like running a Python script to find a derivative of a number, we provide it with examples and let it figure it out by itself without us telling it. Additionally, the machine will learn based on the patterns it detects and understand itself based on what pattern it represents. Let’s think of it this way: rather than telling a computer step-by-step how to find a cat in a photo, we show it thousands of cat pictures and let it discover the visual patterns that make a cat a cat like its ears, whiskers, tail, and pointy ears. The machine will not be able to identify it in one shot, but as we show it thousands of photos of cats continuously, over time, the machine will start to learn the common patterns in the photo and can pick out a cat in a new photo based on the pattern it learned. How is Machine Learning Different from Traditional Programming? Traditional programming follows a straightforward approach: Input + Rules → Output Machine learning flips this process: Input + Output → Rules We give the system inputs (data) and desired outputs, and it learns the rules to transform one into the other. This is powerful because it means the computer can handle tasks that would be impossibly complex to code explicitly. Types of Machine Learning There are three main types: 1. Supervised Learning In supervised learning, we provide examples that are labeled. The machine learns to associate some inputs with some outputs. For example, to develop a spam filter, we might input an algorithm with hundreds of emails that are classified as “spam” or “not spam.” The algorithm learns about the features that distinguish spam mail from good mail. 2. Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning occurs when a model is trained on data without labels. The algorithm tries to learn the patterns or clusters within the data itself. Unsupervised learning can be employed by a retailer who wants to group customers into different categories based on what they buy without knowing beforehand what these groups will be. 3. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is a method whereby an agent is trained to make decisions based on the feedback provided by the environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for actions and learns to maximize rewards with time. This is how AlphaGo was instructed to play the board game of Go at the superhuman level, and robots learn to travel through intricate spaces. This is the reason why beating a chess bot is so hard, as it was trained under reinforcement learning. The Machine Learning Process A typical machine learning project follows these steps: Collect Data: Gather relevant data for your problem. Prepare Data: Clean and format the data so it’s usable. Choose a model: Select an appropriate algorithm for your task. Train the Model: Feed your data to the algorithm so it can learn patterns. Evaluate the Model: Test how well your model performs. Tune Parameters: Adjust settings so that they can improve performance. Make Predictions: Use your trained model on new data. Real-World Applications Machine learning powers many technologies we use daily: Virtual Assistants: Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use machine learning to understand and respond to voice commands. Recommendation Systems: Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon suggest content based on your preferences. Email Filtering: Gmail automatically sorts emails into primary, social, and promotional categories. Medical Diagnosis: Algorithms help doctors detect diseases from medical images. Fraud Detection: Banks use machine learning to identify suspicious transactions. Challenges in Machine Learning Despite its power, machine learning faces several challenges: Data Quality: Models are only as good as the data they’re trained on. Bias: If training data contains biases, the model will likely perpetuate them. Explainability: Complex models often function as “black boxes,” making it difficult to understand how they reach specific conclusions. Privacy Concerns: often requires large amounts of data, raising questions about data privacy. Getting Started with Machine Learning So now, if you’re interested in learning more about machine learning, here are some steps to get started: Learn the Basics: Understand fundamental concepts like algorithms, models, and evaluation metrics like how will your machine learn an image or predict, learn what models are there to train a machine learning model, and how to know if your machine is learning instead of mugging up everything. Study Statistics and Probability: These are the mathematical foundations of machine learning. Yup, math is needed to understand the algorithm I said too, so yes it is very important and we cannot skip this. Pick a Programming Language: Python is the most popular choice for machine learning due to its simplicity and robust libraries. Try Simple Projects: Start with beginner-friendly problems like predicting house prices or classifying images. You can use Kaggle to learn and do projects. Conclusion Machine learning is redefining how we solve issues in industries. By allowing computers to learn from data, we can solve complex problems that would be impossible with traditional programming techniques. The field is developing extremely rapidly, with new methods and applications consistently being discovered. If you’d like to integrate machine learning into your business or are considering doing so as a career, gaining an understanding of the fundamentals is the first step toward tapping its potential. As we advance into the future, machine learning will forever change our world in many exciting ways, making now a great time to dive into this cutting-edge technology.

Introduction: In the world of computers and the internet, most people compete with Mac and Windows, just like comparing iOS and Android not knowing there is something known as Linux. If you are a tech student or one into computers, you might have heard about Linux somewhere. If you’re new to Linux and want to understand why it’s gaining popularity, then this guide, “Linux for Beginners” is for you. Linux is a powerful, secure, and open-source operating system that has become a viable alternative to Windows and macOS. Whether you’re a student, developer, or casual user, Linux offers flexibility and customization to suit your needs. But where have you used it is the question. Those who have not used Linux or maybe have heard it for the first time should know why it is one of the greatest fields to explore. And if you think that it has a great field then why is it not being known as an alternative to Windows and ios, well in reality Linux is used more than these actually, the majority of the world’s cloud computing servers are Linux based. It is a dominating OS for web servers, database servers, and other applications that power the majority of internet services. It is also used in embedded systems like smartwatches, Bluetooth speakers, thermostats cars, and many more. The Android that the majority of you talk about is based on Linux itself, not just that more than 500 computers are using Linux as their operating system, and hackers or expert programmers prefer Linux compared to other OS. So the question arises should we switch to Linux? Should we switch to Linux? We just talked about Linux being used by hackers and developers, not just that I also told you guys about Linux being used in the supercomputer so it means Linux is really fast and cool right? Well not exactly. The majority of Linux is perceived faster because there is no such bloatware like Windows and is lightweight compared to MacOS, so the majority of tasks might feel better in performance compared to other OS but this will depend on your system. I told you about the system cause Linux runs on almost anything and I mean it. Let me tell you more about its advantages. Reasons to Choose Linux Security and Privacy Unlike Mac and Windows, Linux is far secure with strong security features such as no such things as forced updates which are the most irritating things in the majority of OS, and no bloatware and spyware. Unlike other OS, Linux does not track its users and try to fetch their user data, Linux instead provides you full control over the system and lets you decide what to do. One fun thing about is that the majority of viruses in the world are designed for either Windows or MacOS so by default there are very less viruses ever designed that work on Linux making it more secure Open Source and Free: I just told you about how Linux gives us whole control and is transparent to us and this is what developers love about it and thus call it Open source as we can get to know how it was made and how to configure it all on the internet and all for free. So instead of paying for licenses for OS like Windows and macOS, we can just get Linux for free. Just being free makes this a great choice for students and budget-conscious users Performance and Efficiency I talked about hardware to you and why I brought it was because Linux can run on almost all hardware, Linux is lightweight and optimized for performance making it a great choice to revive your old laptop that becomes buggy and slow due to Windows. Just install Linux and feel it as if it’s new. Things to remember before Downloading Linux as a beginner to Linux Hardware Compatibility: Personally, when I downloaded Linux on old hardware there were no such issues like this but when I switched to new-gen laptops a lot of problems arose such as hardware not supporting, divrives not responding and the keyboard not functioning. These are common in Linux as the Linux you download is not fully built according to your laptop but in general consideration of what a simple device looks, so as you get more new gen computer you need to switch to better Linux or download all the hardware and drivers to the current Linux which might be quite hard for new users. Software compatibility: Not just hardware and drivers, so many software are not compatible with Linux too for instance majority of editing software like MS Office, Adobe Platform, and more are not available in Linux normally, we need to hardcode and download them from a third, and still it may not support fully. While Linux does provide you alternatives to this application they may not be that good as you are familiar with the original ones in Windows and MacOS Gaming While Linux gaming has come a long way, many major games still don’t support Linux natively, and you may need Wine or Proton (via Steam) to run Windows-based games, which isn’t always perfect and can require extra configuration. Learning Curve Linux has a steeper learning curve, especially if you’re used to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Windows or macOS. The majority of you have not used a terminal at all and the majority have a GUI for everything so switching from that is hard. You might have to use the terminal (command line) for certain tasks, and troubleshooting often requires technical knowledge. It requires more and more manual setup which might be hard for first-time users. A Ray of Hope For the Passionate Ones With so harsh truth about Linux majority of people have already given up using Linux, but is it bad? Can we use Linux despite these hurdles? Absolutely. And today, we’re here to shine a light on why Linux is still worth it. It may not be a smooth ride but a ride you will always cherish. We can solve most of these problems actually, firstly for driver hardware and software, we can choose a proper distro for this. What is a distro you say?

Big Data Big Data can be defined as data, that is BIG (literally!) . It defines large volumes of data that can be structured or unstructured , mined from various sources in a large quantity. Five Vs define big data: Variety, Volume, Velocity, Value, and Veracity. Big Data is sourced from large, complex sources. Big Data poses a unique challenge addressed by data science. It is a massive capital for businesses and companies that can analyze this data to understand customer behavior, insightful analysis of products and services offered, and predict their purchase and usage behavior. Data science uses various algorithms and processes to derive insights from big data. Deep Learning In computer science, we can define deep learning as the process of machine learning that uses structures similar to human brains (called neural networks). Deep learning is used to make better algorithms, data sets, and AI hardware and software. Deep learning uses powerful computers and large sets of data with output (called supervised learning ) and without output (called unsupervised learning ) to understand and predict patterns and outcomes. In Data Science, we employ the use of neural networks and methodologies to study big data with massive models on a large level computational scale. Usually, we utilize deep learning to create better algorithms, and insights on specifics such as user experience of a product, facial recognition, behavior pattern processing, etc. Data science combines the power of deep learning, data, and computer science to generate new insights and value for businesses. Web Scraping Web scraping is the web data extraction process used to extract data from websites . Automated technology retrieves bulk unstructured data, typically HTML, from numerous websites in the process known as web scraping. A database methodically stores structured data, facilitating its utilization for analysis, training, and research purposes. Data scientists use various existing frameworks such as Scrapy, a Python-based web crawler. Data scientists prefer Beautiful Soup, a tool akin to extracting and storing large website data in databases. Therefore, we use web scraping for price monitoring across e-commerce platforms and email marketing. Similarly, emotion analysis across social media platforms and news monitoring purposes are also done using web scraping. Moreover, this data can also be fed to machine learning algorithms for training and prediction purposes. Natural Language Processing (NLP): One of the most frequent data science terms. Natural Language Processing is a subfield of deep learning that is concerned with Human Linguistics . It is the process of identifying and understanding meaningful phrases from a human language and generating meaningful phrases and sentences that look like a natural form . NLP includes two sub-sections, Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Natural Language Processing involves five phases. Lexical (structure) analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, discourse integration, and pragmatic analysis . Some of the well-known areas of NLP are Speech recognition (Siri, Google Assistant), Chatbots(Maya chat, ), and Optical Character recognition (Google Lens,).

{"id": "sunway_78", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/category/healthcare/", "title": "No Title", "content": "Healthcare Archives - Sunway College Kathmandu Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer Sci-Fi, it’s here, transforming industries, and AI in healthcare is one of the most promising yet complex domains it’s reshaping. From detecting cancer in medical scans to predicting strokes before they occur, AI has the potential to make healthcare faster, more efficient, and more precise. But alongside these advancements come technical hurdles, ethical dilemmas, and critical questions about how much control we should give to algorithms in life-and-death decisions. So, what does the future of AI in healthcare look like? Let’s explore. The Promise of AI in Healthcare AI in medicine is like having a supercharged doctor with a photographic memory and lightning-fast thinking. It’s already changing the game, spotting diseases like Alzheimer’s and breast cancer earlier and more accurately than ever. Hospitals are using AI to cut down ER wait times and manage resources better, while in drug discovery, breakthroughs like DeepMind’s AlphaFold are rewriting the rules of protein research. Imagine taking a pill crafted exclusively for you designed to target your condition with laser precision, minimize side effects, and accelerate recovery. That’s the promise of personalized medicine. At a biomedical hackathon at Kathmandu University, I got a deep dive into human genetics and discovered how genetic sequencing, protein interactions, and biomarker analysis could unlock this future. Of course, challenges like data privacy and algorithmic bias remain, but one thing is clear-AI is revolutionizing healthcare in the best way possible. Key Challenges in Implementation of AI in HealthCare With great power comes great responsibility-and AI in healthcare is the Spider-Man of modern medicine. It’s got all this dazzling potential, but sorry, folks, it’s not as easy as flicking an “on” switch and calling it a day. AI depends on vast amounts of high-quality data, but medical records are often scattered, incomplete, or trapped in outdated systems. When AI feeds on bad data, it produces unreliable predictions, leading to potential misdiagnoses and treatment errors. The challenge isn’t just collecting data but ensuring it is accurate, standardized, and accessible. Then there’s the cost challenge. Developing and implementing AI isn’t inexpensive-it takes a significant investment for hospitals to bring it on board. Smaller clinics and less-funded regions often can’t keep up, watching from the sidelines as larger institutions adopt the technology. This isn’t just unfortunate-it could deepen the gap in healthcare access, where advanced AI tools are mostly available to well-resourced facilities. Patient care shouldn’t feel exclusive, should it? Then there’s the issue of trust. Doctors aren’t always eager to embrace algorithms-they’ve spent years building their expertise through hands-on experience, not managing software. Many view AI with skepticism, unsure of its role in their practice. Without thorough training and clear evidence that AI supports rather than replaces their judgment, adoption will likely remain gradual. AI’s role in healthcare must be that of an assistant, not an authority-augmenting human expertise rather than attempting to replace it. The potential? Oh, it’s huge -AI could be the rockstar of healthcare. But if we don’t tackle these hiccups, it might just end up as another overhyped gadget gathering dust in the corner. Ethical Concerns Beyond technical and financial barriers, AI in healthcare raises serious ethical questions. Let’s ensure this revolution succeeds, time to address the challenges thoughtfully and focus on effective solutions! Privacy and Data Security AI requires access to extensive patient data to function effectively, but this poses risks. Medical records contain highly sensitive information-who controls access, and how can we ensure data remains secure? Patients deserve transparency and strict safeguards against breaches or misuse. Bias and Fairness AI systems learn from old data, and sometimes that data has a few sneaky flaws. If it shortchanges certain groups, the AI might not treat everyone fairly. Case in point: one fancy AI once underestimated Black patients’ needs because it was fed healthcare spending stats that weren’t quite balanced. Fixing these little hiccups is a must to keep AI healthcare fair for all. Accountability and Trust When AI makes a medical error, who is responsible-the doctor, the developer, or the algorithm itself? Unlike human professionals, AI cannot explain its reasoning in a way we always understand, making accountability difficult. Trust in AI requires transparency, rigorous testing, and the ability for healthcare providers to interpret and validate AI recommendations. NeuroVision: A Case Study in Responsible AI Development One project that highlights AI’s potential, when developed responsibly, is NeuroVision. This initiative uses AI to classify brain tumors from DICOM medical images, based on a proposed technical architecture that integrates deep learning models with cloud-based processing for improved speed and accuracy. The dataset for this system is developed using Functional APIs, which enable efficient handling and structuring of complex medical imaging data. If implemented with proper ethical considerations, it could significantly enhance early tumor detection, leading to faster diagnoses and improved treatment planning. However, for NeuroVision to succeed ethically, several factors must be addressed: Data Transparency & Security : Ensuring patient imaging data is handled with the highest standards of encryption and privacy protection. Bias Mitigation : Training the model on diverse datasets to avoid racial, gender, or socioeconomic disparities in diagnosis. Explainability : Implementing explainable AI (XAI) techniques to help radiologists understand why the AI reached a particular conclusion, rather than treating it as a “black box.” Collaboration with Medical Experts : Ensuring that NeuroVision remains a tool that assists radiologists rather than replaces them, maintaining human oversight in critical decisions. If developed with these ethical pillars in mind, NeuroVision could set an example for responsible AI integration in healthcare, proving that innovation and responsibility can go hand in hand. The Road Ahead: Balancing Innovation and Responsibility The future of AI in healthcare all comes down to finding that sweet spot. We need strong rules to make sure AI plays fair, owns up to its mistakes, and keeps our data safe. And let’s be real-transparency matters. If patients and doctors can’t figure out how AI comes up with its answers, they’re not going to trust it, plain and simple. The trick is teamwork. AI techies, doctors, ethicists, and policymakers have to join forces to build systems that aren’t just cutting-edge but also decent and focused on people. Think of it like a three-legged stool: you’ve got innovation, responsibility, and trust holding it up. Kick one out, and the whole thing comes crashing down. The good news? We’re already seeing some wins. A few hospitals are testing out AI that explains itself, governments are sketching out ethics rules, and researchers are digging into the messy stuff like bias and fairness. Still, we’ve got a ways to go-nobody said this would be a quick fix! Conclusion AI could shake up healthcare-think of quicker diagnoses, sharper treatments, and healthier vibes all around. But let’s not kid ourselves: tech isn’t some magic fix-it wand. It’s more like a trusty tool, and we’ve got to use it right. The point isn’t to swap out doctors for robots-it’s to give them a boost so they can help us better. So, here’s the big question: Can we make sure AI’s got humanity’s back without messing up on ethics, fairness, or trust? If cool projects like NeuroVision show us how to do AI the responsible way, I’d say we’ve got a solid shot at a “heck yes.” What’s your take where do we set the boundaries?

If you are a tech student or one into computers, you might have heard about Linux somewhere. If you’re new to Linux and want to understand why it’s gaining popularity, then this guide, “Linux for Beginners” is for you. Linux is a powerful, secure, and open-source operating system that has become a viable alternative to Windows and macOS. Whether you’re a student, developer, or casual user, Linux offers flexibility and customization to suit your needs. But where have you used it is the question. Those who have not used Linux or maybe have heard it for the first time should know why it is one of the greatest fields to explore. And if you think that it has a great field then why is it not being known as an alternative to Windows and ios, well in reality Linux is used more than these actually, the majority of the world’s cloud computing servers are Linux based. It is a dominating OS for web servers, database servers, and other applications that power the majority of internet services. It is also used in embedded systems like smartwatches, Bluetooth speakers, thermostats cars, and many more. The Android that the majority of you talk about is based on Linux itself, not just that more than 500 computers are using Linux as their operating system, and hackers or expert programmers prefer Linux compared to other OS. So the question arises should we switch to Linux? Should we switch to Linux? We just talked about Linux being used by hackers and developers, not just that I also told you guys about Linux being used in the supercomputer so it means Linux is really fast and cool right? Well not exactly. The majority of Linux is perceived faster because there is no such bloatware like Windows and is lightweight compared to MacOS, so the majority of tasks might feel better in performance compared to other OS but this will depend on your system. I told you about the system cause Linux runs on almost anything and I mean it. Let me tell you more about its advantages. Reasons to Choose Linux Security and Privacy Unlike Mac and Windows, Linux is far secure with strong security features such as no such things as forced updates which are the most irritating things in the majority of OS, and no bloatware and spyware. Unlike other OS, Linux does not track its users and try to fetch their user data, Linux instead provides you full control over the system and lets you decide what to do. One fun thing about is that the majority of viruses in the world are designed for either Windows or MacOS so by default there are very less viruses ever designed that work on Linux making it more secure Open Source and Free: I just told you about how Linux gives us whole control and is transparent to us and this is what developers love about it and thus call it Open source as we can get to know how it was made and how to configure it all on the internet and all for free. So instead of paying for licenses for OS like Windows and macOS, we can just get Linux for free. Just being free makes this a great choice for students and budget-conscious users Performance and Efficiency I talked about hardware to you and why I brought it was because Linux can run on almost all hardware, Linux is lightweight and optimized for performance making it a great choice to revive your old laptop that becomes buggy and slow due to Windows. Just install Linux and feel it as if it’s new. Things to remember before Downloading Linux as a beginner to Linux Hardware Compatibility: Personally, when I downloaded Linux on old hardware there were no such issues like this but when I switched to new-gen laptops a lot of problems arose such as hardware not supporting, divrives not responding and the keyboard not functioning. These are common in Linux as the Linux you download is not fully built according to your laptop but in general consideration of what a simple device looks, so as you get more new gen computer you need to switch to better Linux or download all the hardware and drivers to the current Linux which might be quite hard for new users. Software compatibility: Not just hardware and drivers, so many software are not compatible with Linux too for instance majority of editing software like MS Office, Adobe Platform, and more are not available in Linux normally, we need to hardcode and download them from a third, and still it may not support fully. While Linux does provide you alternatives to this application they may not be that good as you are familiar with the original ones in Windows and MacOS Gaming While Linux gaming has come a long way, many major games still don’t support Linux natively, and you may need Wine or Proton (via Steam) to run Windows-based games, which isn’t always perfect and can require extra configuration. Learning Curve Linux has a steeper learning curve, especially if you’re used to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Windows or macOS. The majority of you have not used a terminal at all and the majority have a GUI for everything so switching from that is hard. You might have to use the terminal (command line) for certain tasks, and troubleshooting often requires technical knowledge. It requires more and more manual setup which might be hard for first-time users. A Ray of Hope For the Passionate Ones With so harsh truth about Linux majority of people have already given up using Linux, but is it bad? Can we use Linux despite these hurdles? Absolutely. And today, we’re here to shine a light on why Linux is still worth it. It may not be a smooth ride but a ride you will always cherish. We can solve most of these problems actually, firstly for driver hardware and software, we can choose a proper distro for this. What is a distro you say? So Linux has a lot of Operating Systems you can choose from each providing a collection of software packages such as system libraries, utilities, application software, and a desktop environment which makes each distro unique. And if you are a beginner and want to experience Linux with more GUI like your old OS but have Linux in it I have the best suggestion for you which supports a lot of your favorite Windows and Mac software and your deceived hardware and drivers too - introducing Zorin OS! Why Choose Zorin OS 1. Windows-Like Interface Adapting to the Linux desktop environment stands as the biggest problem like we said for people new to the Linux operating system. The Zorin OS desktop adopts an interface that resembles Windows which eases the transition process for Windows users. It also has an appearance for macOS users which is the same as Mac. 2. Easy Installation Process The installation of Zorin OS remains simple because the user-friendly setup wizard provides an easy experience.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a hot topic in the tech industry, with opinions ranging from it being a revolutionary boom to a potential doom. It has raised a big question: Artificial Intelligence dilemma, a shortcut or a Roadblock? AI has undeniably transformed the field of technology, significantly speeding up development processes. Before the advent of Artificial Intelligence(AI) tools, developing a full-stack web application could take over a month. Now, with clear requirements, it can be accomplished in less than a week. This acceleration is indeed fascinating, especially for senior developers who can leverage AI to enhance their productivity. However, the impact of AI on junior developers is a different story. While AI tools offer a quick path to creating sophisticated applications, they also pose a significant risk: over-reliance. Junior developers, who are just entering the tech field, may become too dependent on these tools, potentially hindering their long-term growth and understanding of fundamental concepts. The Artificial Intelligence Dilemma: Efficiency vs. Learning Imagine two developers, a junior and a senior tasked with building a full-stack e-commerce web application. The junior developer is allowed to use any AI tool, while the senior developer must rely solely on their technical skills, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and other resources. Initially, the junior developer’s application might appear more polished and feature-rich. However, the true test comes when both are asked to make small changes without the aid of AI tools. The junior developer, accustomed to AI assistance, might struggle to implement these changes efficiently and bug-free. In contrast, the senior developer, with a deep understanding of the fundamentals, can make the necessary adjustments smoothly. This scenario highlights a critical issue: Junior developers may be skipping essential learning steps by relying too heavily on AI tools. The Importance of Fundamentals One of the major problems observed in junior developers today is a lack of interest in learning the fundamentals. They often want to jump straight into advanced topics and tools without building a strong foundation. This approach can lead to a superficial understanding of technology, making it difficult to troubleshoot issues or adapt to new challenges without AI assistance. The Future of Software Development Despite the concerns, it’s unlikely that software developers or engineers will lose their jobs to AI. Instead, Artificial Intelligence will likely change the workflow, making processes more efficient. The role of a software engineer might evolve, but it won’t be replaced by AI entirely. The idea of “Software Engineer 2.0” being synonymous with “Machine Learning Engineer” is a misconception. The future will still require developers with a solid grasp of fundamentals, who can use AI tools as an enhancement rather than a crutch. Adapting to the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven workforce A recent study conducted by Pearson, in partnership with ServiceNow, provides an extensive analysis of the potential effects of AI and automation on the economies of six countries (U.S., UK, Germany, India, Australia, and Japan) and how technology-based roles are expected to evolve. Despite concern from potentially affected groups, this research shows that junior application developers will remain valuable even as AI continues to evolve. The study suggests that in the coming years, those junior developers who can understand and adapt to their new roles will be best prepared to thrive in the AI-driven workforce of the future. The rise of AI and automation significantly impacts the skills required for junior developers to succeed in the tech industry. By analyzing their workflows and identifying areas where automation can provide the most significant value, developers can implement automation tools and processes, freeing time for more complex work. Project-based learning is a popular and effective way for new developers to gain hands-on experience and apply their coding skills to real-world challenges. However, this approach also presents its own set of unique challenges. Many new developers encounter pitfalls, but mastering code quality can set them apart in a competitive industry. Conclusion AI tools offer tremendous potential for accelerating development and enhancing productivity. However, for junior developers, over-reliance on these tools can be a double-edged sword. While they provide a quick path to creating complex applications, they can also hinder the learning of essential fundamentals. The key is to strike a balance: use AI tools to augment your skills, but never at the expense of understanding the core principles of software development. By doing so, junior developers can grow into well-rounded, competent professionals capable of adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape. I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and I’m excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, it’s not that straightforward. 🍿 Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, it’s essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Here’s what I discovered: 📉 Decline in Length: Genres like Children’s and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content. 📈 Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friend’s data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization , boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021 . Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If we’re going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas . But first we’ll need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Let’s start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python : a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. We’ll also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Let’s perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friend’s assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friend’s aggregations, we’re limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path \"datasets/netflix_data.csv\" . Let’s create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friend’s data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type . Scanning the column, it’s clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show (perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons)? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie . While we’re at it, we don’t need information from all of the columns, so let’s create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title , country , genre , release_year , and duration . Let’s put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. We’ve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Let’s try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so let’s try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much rmative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Let’s filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as “Children”, “Stand-Up”, and “Documentaries”. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For rmation, you can refer to the documentation here ! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, we’ll also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use() . The latter isn’t taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find rmation on customizing the style of your plot here ! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as children’s movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we can’t know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, you’ve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas . This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas . We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri At our IT and research club has developed a creative IoT Based Water dispenser.

One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha (and team) have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at (March 2021 Intake). Let’s have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor ? The rise of IoT (Internet of Things) is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system ‘ IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor ’ is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. There’s usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 (Temperature-Humidity Sensor) Bread Board DS18B20 (Water Temperature Sensor) Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil & Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, let’s understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the project’s outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result & Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ide’s serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometer’s serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of . I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway College’s research lab and beyond that.

{"id": "sunway_91", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/", "title": "No Title", "content": "Sunway Students, Author at Sunway College Kathmandu The farming world has always been at the mercy of nature. While farming has seen impressive success through modern practices in improving yield, pest control, and weather management, one constant threat always lingers over agriculture: crop disease. Whether rust in wheat, blight in potato, or mildew in grape, crop disease has long been a thorn in the flesh for farmers. Crop diseases can completely destroy harvests, wiping out small-scale and large-scale farms equally. But what if we could predict crop diseases before they are an issue, allowing farmers to respond to the very first indications that something is amiss. That’s where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in. With the incorporation of advanced machine learning algorithms, image recognition, and real-time data, AI is turning farmers into disease detectives-identifying potential problems well ahead of time before they get out of hand. Let us take a closer look at how AI is revolutionizing the prediction, control, and prevention of crop disease. The Challenge of Crop Diseases Before explaining how AI helps, one needs to understand the scope and magnitude of crop disease. Crop disease is the cause of an astronomical amount of loss of food worldwide annually. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates plant diseases as being to blame for as much as 40% of global crop loss-loss that translates to direct crop damage and cost of pesticides and disease control. Farmers usually rely on a combination of visual inspections, expert judgment, and weather forecasts to predict and manage diseases. But these controls are usually too late or are not specific enough. Diseases are apt to become uncontrollable fast, especially in large fields, and by the time they have been detected, it is too late to avert the harm. Traditional Methods of Disease Detection The ways of detecting crop diseases in the past were fairly primitive: Expert or farmer visual inspections that can easily miss early signs. Field sampling wherein parts of crops are being sent to labs to be analyzed, a slow process that may or may not deliver real-time feedback. Weather predictions, used to identify conditions (rain, temperature, humidity) favorable to disease epidemics, but without information on whether or not a crop in a specific region is indeed infected. These techniques are not as proactive but are rather reactive, and they are normally infested with human elements, lapses in time, and the sheer magnitude of modern-day farms. AI: The Disease Detective Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML), introduces a revolutionized approach to the problem of crop diseases. Machine learning is a branch of AI that enables systems to learn from experience, become more intelligent with time, and take decisions autonomously with minimal human intervention. It can be utilized in agriculture to recognize patterns, predict future events, and generate implementable outcomes. This is how AI is transforming the prediction of crop diseases: 1. Image Recognition for Early Disease Detection One of the most powerful uses of AI in agriculture is image recognition. Crops are captured in high-resolution photos by drones, satellites, and even hand-held cameras. The photos are fed into AI algorithms that have been programmed to see even the smallest indication of disease-often before the human eye can do so. For example: Leaf spots, a first indication of disease, may be identified in an image by machine learning algorithms that have been trained to recognize patterns in leaf shape, texture, and color. Innovative machine learning algorithms can even identify discoloration or wilting symptoms of infection caused by fungi or bacteria through images of the plant. The beauty is that this process can be scaled up. AI can cut through thousands of images from drones or satellite imagery to detect possible outbreaks in real-time, thus allowing early intervention. 2. Predictive Analytics for Disease Forecasting It can also predict the outbreak of disease by analyzing huge ranges of data points. It does not just look for observable clues, but accounts for other variables like: Weather conditions-temperature, rainfall, humidity Soil conditions Crop type and variety Disease history data AI could then present a probability calculation of the occurrence of specific diseases in specific regions, depending on environmental factors and existing patterns from previous seasons. As an illustration, if an AI system detects a high-humidity, high-temperature scenario-ideal for fungal growth-it can initiate farmers to adopt preventive actions like the application of fungicides, adjustment of irrigation schedule, or inspection of vulnerable crop zones. 3. Machine Learning for Continuous Improvement Machine learning programs improve over time. With each new set of data, AI is more and more able to make accurate disease predictions. The more it looks at pictures and the more it consumes from the world around it, the more it will see pre-symptomatic indicators of crop disease. For instance, the deep learning models are usually applied to identify and classify diseases based on plant images. The model continuously learns from the feedback it receives. If the farmer identifies a disease (or not) correctly (or wrongly), the AI platform refines its idea of the disease and improves the predictions. 4. Integration with Internet of Things (IoT) Devices AI predictability is also enhanced when merged with IoT devices on the farm. IoT devices are able to monitor environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real time. When merged with drone or satellite data, the real-time information stream gives the AI system the context of each crop, which makes the disease predictions even more precise. For example, the soil sensors may register low nitrogen levels, a stress factor that can predispose crops to disease infection. The AI system may suggest a specific remedy, for example, the application of fertilizers to boost the plants’ health. Benefits of Using AI for Disease Prediction The impact of using AI for forecasting crop disease is gigantic. Let us consider the most important advantages: 1. Preemptive Disease Management The strongest attribute of AI in the prediction of diseases is to act before a disease becomes entrenched. The traditional way is to react after diseases begin to spread. In contrast, AI allows farmers to catch problems early, at a stage when they can still avoid massive damage. 2. Targeted Interventions Through the application of AI, farmers will be in a position to make more fact-based, informed choices. Instead of spraying fungicides or pesticides over an entire field, AI will determine where the disease is most likely to appear. This makes for better-targeted use of chemicals, saving cash and cutting back on environmental damage. 3. Higher Yield and Lower Losses Disease detection with AI leads to healthier plants and ultimately higher yields. Because the farmers are able to prevent the worst of the disease, they are less likely to incur crushing crop loss, which translates into greater profitability. 4. Cost Savings Prevention of an outbreak of disease is far less expensive than addressing its effects. By accurate prediction of where and when a disease will appear, farmers do not waste money on treatments that are expensive, labor, and replanting. 5. Sustainability Disease forecasting using AI renders agriculture more sustainable by reducing the reliance on high pesticide application and soil fertility. It not only reduces the environmental footprint of agriculture, but also the risk of chemical resistance in pests and diseases is minimized. Real-World Examples of AI in Crop Disease Prediction Plantix (Germany) Plantix, a mobile application for plant health, uses AI and image recognition to help farmers diagnose crop diseases. Farmers take a photo of their plants, and the AI checks the image for disease, pest, or nutrient deficiency. The app then recommends treatment and connects farmers with experts. IBM Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture IBM’s platform uses AI, weather information, and block-chain to allow farmers to foresee and plan against diseases. The platform’s AI uses historical and real-time data and provides predictions on crop health along with recommending specific actions for disease prevention. Crop sensor (USA) Crop sensor uses AI-powered drones and sensors to monitor the health of the crops. AI algorithms analyze the data and predict the likely eruption of diseases and give farmers an early beginning for disease control. The Future of AI in Crop Disease Prediction The future of AI in crop disease prediction looks incredibly promising. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more powerful tools for disease prevention, including: Real-time drone surveillance with AI analysis on the go. More sophisticated weather models predicting disease risks. Automated disease management systems, where AI directly controls drones or sprayers to apply treatments only where needed. The intersection of AI and agriculture isn’t just about making farming more efficient; it’s about saving the planet’s food supply, one smart prediction at a time. Conclusion Artificial Intelligence is transforming crop disease management for farmers by delivering solutions that not only warn when the disease will strike, but also pre-empt its occurrence in the first place. Through predictive analytics, machine learning, and pre-emptive warning, farmers today are more empowered than ever to safeguard their crops, reduce waste, and enhance yield. With advancements in this technology along the lines they’re currently headed, there’s no question that AI will be a part of the future of agriculture-helping us feed more people on this planet more sustainably and efficiently. Agriculturists do not need to wait for the diseases to manifest themselves before acting. With AI, they are able to get ahead and keep their crops-and their businesses-disease-free in the next few years. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept; it’s a global force reshaping industries, economies, and daily life. From optimizing complex systems to personalizing user experiences, AI’s potential is undeniable. Like many nations, Nepal is awakening to this transformative power and grappling with how best to harness it for national development while mitigating potential risks. The recent unveiling of the draft National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy 2081 (corresponding to 2025 AD) signals a significant step in this direction. But is this initial stride enough? This post delves into the current state of AI policy in Nepal. Similarly, identifies crucial missing pieces. Also, explores the necessary next steps to build a robust and beneficial AI ecosystem for the nation, and also speaks about Nepal’s AI policy. The Current Landscape: Nepal’s Initial Steps into AI Governance Nepal’s journey towards formal AI governance isn’t starting from scratch. The Digital Nepal Framework 2076 (2019 AD) laid some groundwork, emphasizing AI, big data, and cloud computing. It worked as a key technological pillar for the nation’s digital transformation. Building on this, the draft National AI Policy 2081, released for public consultation by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MoCIT) in early 2025, marks a dedicated effort to create a strategic framework for AI. Key Highlights of the Draft Policy: Visionary Goals: The policy sets a vision for AI-driven digital transformation, aiming to integrate AI into key economic and social sectors like agriculture, healthcare, tourism, education, and governance to boost productivity and align with national development goals. Institutional Framework: It proposes creating new bodies to guide and regulate AI: National AI Center: To serve as the primary regulatory body overseeing AI growth, usage, and research. AI Regulation Council: Headed by the MoCIT Minister, focusing on ethical oversight, ensuring AI benefits society while respecting human rights and privacy, and aligning with international standards. AI Excellence Centers: To be established in universities and research institutions at national and provincial levels to foster R&D, focusing on ethical data handling and priority sectors. Infrastructure and Ethics: The policy acknowledges the need for expanding digital infrastructure (like 5G, fiber optics, data centers, cloud services) and places a strong emphasis on ethical AI development and regulation. While government-led initiatives are nascent, Nepal’s private sector shows glimpses of AI adoption. Startups like Fuse machines Nepal and Paaila Technology are working on AI-driven solutions in areas like chatbots, automation, and data analytics, particularly in finance, e-commerce, and potentially healthcare. However, this growth remains somewhat limited, often happening in pockets rather than as part of a coordinated national strategy. Identifying the Gaps: What’s Missing in Nepal’s AI Policy Strategy? Despite the commendable intentions laid out in the draft policy, several critical gaps and challenges need addressing for Nepal to effectively leverage AI. 1. The Implementation Chasm : The draft policy outlines ambitious goals but according to analysis, lacks a concrete roadmap. Crucial details regarding responsible agencies, specific funding mechanisms, timelines, and measurable outcomes are missing. Without these, there’s a significant risk of the policy remaining largely aspirational, confined to paper rather than practice. 2. Foundational Weaknesses: Infrastructure & Data: AI thrives on data and robust infrastructure. Nepal faces significant hurdles here: Infrastructure Deficit: Limited high-speed internet penetration, unreliable electricity supply, and inadequate access to advanced computing power and data centers severely restrict AI development and deployment. Data Governance: While the policy mentions data, it needs more explicit policies on data governance, including data quality standards, cleansing, security protocols, privacy protection, and clear regulations for cross-border data sharing. 3. The R&D and Skills Deficit: Meaningful AI development requires strong research capabilities and a skilled workforce. Underfunded R&D: Nepal invests less than 1% of its GDP in research and development, leaving institutions under-resourced. The draft policy encourages university collaboration and research centers, but without a clear financing strategy for AI labs and R&D hubs, Nepal may remain dependent on foreign technology. Talent Gap & Awareness: There’s a recognized shortage of AI professionals and low AI literacy among the broader population. Building a skilled workforce through dedicated educational programs and raising public awareness are critical yet underdeveloped areas. 4. Regulatory Vagueness and Ethical Implementation: While the draft mentions ethics and proposes a council, the governance section needs more teeth. Clearer guidelines are needed on transparency, accountability, bias mitigation, cybersecurity standards, data privacy enforcement (beyond just confidentiality, integrity, availability), and preventing misuse for surveillance or disinformation. The policy needs a well-defined, applicable definition of AI and a comprehensive glossary. 5. Stimulating the Ecosystem : The policy mentions public-private partnerships (PPPs) but lacks concrete details on incentives to encourage private sector investment and AI entrepreneurship. Tax breaks, startup grants, venture capital matching schemes, and dedicated innovation hubs are needed to catalyze the ecosystem, like approaches in countries like India or Singapore. 6. Localization Lag : For AI to be truly inclusive and effective across Nepal, solutions need to be developed and adapted for Nepali and other regional languages and contexts. Charting the Path Forward: What’s Next for Nepal’s AI Policy? Addressing these gaps requires a concerted and strategic effort. The following steps are crucial for Nepal’s AI journey: 1. Finalize and Operationalize the Policy : Incorporate stakeholder feedback (including recommendations from bodies like the CAN Federation) into the draft policy. Most importantly, translate the finalized policy into a clear, actionable, and funded implementation plan with defined roles, responsibilities, and timelines. 2. Build the Bedrock Infrastructure First: Prioritize substantial investment in core digital infrastructure: reliable power, nationwide high-speed internet, and secure, state-of-the-art data centers and cloud capabilities. This is non-negotiable for any serious AI ambition. 3. Invest in People and Ideas: Dramatically increase funding for AI research and development. Establish and adequately resource the proposed AI Excellence Centers. Integrate AI into university curricula, offer scholarships, and launch nationwide AI literacy and upskilling programs. 4. Develop Robust Legal & Ethical Guardrails : Craft clear, specific, and enforceable regulations covering data protection, cybersecurity, ethical AI principles (fairness, transparency, accountability), and responsible AI use. Ensure these legal frameworks protect citizens’ rights while fostering innovation. 5. Catalyze Collaboration and Investment: Design and implement attractive incentives for private sector AI development, startups, and PPPs. Foster a collaborative environment between government, academia, industry, and civil society. Explore strategic international partnerships, potentially learning from models like the Singapore-Rwanda AI Playbook for resource pooling. 6. Prioritize Localization and Sectoral Impact: Actively support the development of AI tools tailored to Nepal’s linguistic and cultural diversity. Continue focusing AI applications on key sectors (agriculture, health, education, disaster management) where they can deliver maximum societal and economic benefits. Artificial Intelligence holds immense potential to accelerate Nepal’s development, enhance public services, and create new economic opportunities. The draft National AI Policy 2081 is a vital first step, signaling the government’s commitment. However, a policy document alone is insufficient. Real work lies ahead: bridging the gap between ambition and action. This requires moving beyond broad statements to concrete implementation plans. Additionally, securing dedicated funding, building foundational infrastructure, nurturing local talent, establishing clear ethical and legal frameworks, and fostering a vibrant ecosystem through collaboration and smart incentives. By addressing the missing pieces and strategically charting the next steps, Nepal can harness the power of AI. It can harness not just to keep pace with the world, but to build a more prosperous and inclusive future. Also, it can harness a resilient future for all its citizens. The journey requires a collective effort, and the government should unite the industry, academia, and the public. It should unite towards a shared vision of responsible and impactful AI development. Introduction: Why Blockchain, Why Now? As the world moves forward with new technologies, Nepal isn’t staying too far behind. We’re seeing more people talk about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning every day, and slowly but surely, Nepal is adopting them too. But here’s something you don’t hear as often-what about blockchain? Why isn’t blockchain getting the same attention in Nepal? Is it just because cryptocurrency is banned here? In this blog, I want to explore the potential of blockchain in Nepal-beyond just crypto. We’ll look at how it works, what’s already happening, and why it could be a game-changer for our country. So, here’s the big question: Is blockchain the tool that can help Nepal grow stronger, smarter, and fairer? What is Blockchain, Really? At a glance, blockchain is an application of Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT). At its core, it’s a digital ledger-a secure, decentralized system that records transactions across a network of computers. Unlike traditional databases controlled by central authorities, blockchain is transparent, tamper-resistant, and maintained collectively by its participants. Though Bitcoin popularized the term, blockchain technology’s potential goes far beyond cryptocurrencies. From tracking supply chains to securing elections, blockchain is a paradigm shift in how data is stored, verified, and trusted. How Does Blockchain Actually Work? Think of blockchain like a shared Google Doc. Everyone has access, everyone can verify what’s been added, but no one can erase or rewrite history. Each block in the chain is a digital record that contains a bundle of data or transactions. These blocks are arranged chronologically, and every block references the hash (a unique identifier) of the previous one. This creates a secure chain where changing a single block would require altering all subsequent ones-a virtually impossible feat without immense computational power. Here’s a simplified step-by-step breakdown: A transaction is requested. The transaction is broadcast to a peer-to-peer network. The network validates the transaction using algorithms. Once verified, the transaction is bundled into a block. The new block is added to the existing blockchain. The transaction is complete and permanently recorded. This structure ensures security, transparency, and immutability, making blockchain ideal for environments where trust and accountability are paramount. Use Cases and Pilot Projects in Nepal Nepal is already experimenting with blockchain in exciting ways: Agriculture AgriClear : This platform uses blockchain to track products from farm to table. Consumers can scan QR codes to verify the origin of goods like Jumla apples, ensuring quality and traceability. Rural Development Digital Village Initiative (FAO) : Municipalities like Kalinchowk, Rong, and Chhinnamasta are piloting digital tools, including blockchain-powered systems and IoT-enabled irrigation, to boost agricultural productivity and climate resilience. Education Academic Credential Verification : Blockchain is being explored to issue tamper-proof digital certificates. This would simplify verification for employers and reduce fraud in academic qualifications. These initiatives underscore Nepal’s proactive approach to using blockchain for sustainable development. Challenges to Adoption Despite early progress, several hurdles remain: Digital Infrastructure : Many rural regions lack reliable internet access. Policy & Regulation : Nepal currently has unclear or restrictive policies on cryptocurrency and blockchain-related ventures. Awareness & Expertise : Blockchain is still new to most educators, policymakers, and the public. Addressing these issues is critical for broader implementation. The Synergy of AI and Blockchain Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two of the most transformative technologies of our time. While they come from different roots, blockchain being a decentralized ledger system and AI being a decision-making and data analysis engine, their integration opens up powerful possibilities. Here’s how AI and blockchain complement each other: 1. Transparent Data Source : Blockchain provides clean, traceable data that AI can trust for training and analysis. Every data entry on a blockchain is verifiable, making it a reliable foundation for AI models. 2. Autonomous Systems : Decentralized AI can be built using blockchain. Instead of relying on a single server, AI operations can be distributed across multiple nodes, promoting autonomy and reducing single points of failure. 3. Privacy Protection : Blockchain’s cryptographic foundations protect data privacy during AI training and operations. This makes it safer to work with sensitive data while maintaining model performance. 4. Distributed Computing Power : AI requires vast computing resources. Blockchain helps by pooling distributed systems, reducing hardware costs, and balancing energy loads. 5. Enhanced Security : Smart contracts on blockchains can have vulnerabilities. AI can detect and prevent exploitation by improving the logic and resilience of these contracts. 6. Improved Data Handling : AI improves the efficiency of reading and querying blockchain data. Techniques like the TTA-CB protocol combined with optimization algorithms can make data storage and retrieval faster. 7. Authenticity & Auditability : AI decisions can be hard to explain. Blockchain helps by keeping an immutable log of data, model changes, and decision steps, supporting explainable AI and trust in its outputs. 8. Augmentation : AI adds intelligence to blockchain-based systems. It can process large datasets quickly and offer actionable insights, enabling smart automation and model sharing across networks. 9. Automation : Smart contracts can use AI to make real-time decisions-for example, choosing the most efficient shipping method or resolving disputes automatically. Together, AI and blockchain can create decentralized AI systems that are more transparent, secure, and scalable. From protecting healthcare data to improving logistics and enabling smart governance, their synergy is already shaping the future. Education and Awareness in Nepal Blockchain is still a relatively new concept for many in nepal, but awareness is slowly starting to grow among people. While as I stated at the beginning of this blog that this technology is often misunderstood as just “crypto”. Educational efforts are beginning to clarify its real-world potential. Some institutions like Kathmandu University have started offering introductory sessions and short courses on blockchain. These just cover the basics, how blockchain works, its use cases, adn tools like Ethereum, Solana and smart contracts. However, such programs are still limited and are mostly available in few urban universities There’s currently no dedicated undergraduate or postgraduate programs focused solely on blockchain technology. Most students still learn about it informally, through youtube, online courses or developers forums. Community and Events Nepal’s blockchain ecosystem is rapidly evolving, driven by a collaborative network of organizations and communities dedicated to education, innovation, and secure digital transformation. eSatya eSatya is a leading blockchain initiative in Nepal, dedicated to advancing blockchain education and development. In January 2025, eSatya hosted the “Bringing Devcon to Kathmandu” event, sponsored by Devcon as part of its Satellite Events funding round. The event featured screenings of Ethereum Devcon keynotes and facilitated discussions on Ethereum’s global impact, aiming to inspire local developers and enthusiasts . Additionally, eSatya offers a 12-week Blockchain Fellowship Program, supported by the Ethereum Foundation’s Ecosystem Support Program. This mentor-led course equips participants with practical skills in blockchain development, including smart contract creation and decentralized application (DApp) development. In the 2023 cohort, 17 out of 22 fellows successfully completed the program and presented their projects, such as blockchain-based digital health records and decentralized finance applications. HimalAI HimalAI is an emerging tech community in Nepal that focuses on integrating blockchain with artificial intelligence. In April 2025, HimalAI organized a 48-hour AI/Web3 Hackathon at the HimalAI Hacker House near Tribhuvan University in Kirtipur. The event brought together developers, data scientists, and entrepreneurs to collaborate on innovative solutions leveraging the combined power of AI and blockchain technologies. Participants competed for NPR 100,000 in prizes and engaged in workshops and keynotes covering topics such as AI tools, Web3 applications, data collection, and model fine-tuning . The hackathon aimed to foster a collaborative environment for building real-world solutions and advancing the tech ecosystem in Nepal. Blockchain Foundation Nepal serves as a community-driven platform, bringing together blockchain enthusiasts, developers, and professionals through regular meetups and discussions to explore blockchain-based solutions and foster an active blockchain community in Nepal. CryptoGen Nepal , a cybersecurity firm, plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem by ensuring the security of blockchain applications and infrastructure. Their services include IS audits, vulnerability assessments, and incident response, helping safeguard blockchain platforms against potential threats. Nepal Internet Governance Forum (Nepal IGF) is a multi stakeholder platform that discusses internet governance issues, including the development and regulation of emerging technologies like blockchain. By bringing together government, private sector, civil society, and technical community representatives, Nepal IGF facilitates dialogues that shape the future of internet and blockchain policies in the country. Together, these organizations are cultivating a robust blockchain ecosystem in Nepal, promoting education, innovation, and secure implementation of blockchain technologies across various sectors. Challenges Despite these efforts, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption and understanding onr blockchain in Nepal: Limited Formal Education: Blockchain technology is not yet a standard part of academic curricula in most educational institutions. Misconceptions: There is prevalent confucsion between blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, leading to skepticism and hesitancy in embracing blockchain solutions. Resource constraints: Access to necessary resources, such as computing infrastructures and expert mentorship, is limited, particularly in rural areas Future Opportunities for Nepal Nepal can unlock tremendous value with blockchain in areas like: Voting Systems : Secure, transparent digital voting. Land Registries : Immutable, accessible property records. Disaster Relief : Transparent fund allocation during emergencies. Tourism : Blockchain-based tourist identity and insurance solutions. With proper policy and public-private partnerships, Nepal can become a blockchain innovation hub in South Asia. Conclusion Nepal is not too late to the blockchain revolution in fact, it may be just on time. By embracing this technology strategically, we can foster transparency, fight corruption, and empower citizens from the Himalayas to the Terai. Let us not wait for revolutions to happen. Let us build them, block by block. We are in a time when artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over our world, and its influence on the job market is generally taking a negative turn. You must have heard ominous statements: “AI is taking our jobs,” “Machines are making humans obsolete,” or “Automation means unemployment.” While such headlines are good clickbait material, they miss a fundamental point: AI isn’t so much eliminating jobs as it is transforming them. While it’s true that automation is revolutionizing the workforce, the idea that AI is taking human jobs overlooks a more subtle and hopeful reality. What’s really happening is that work roles are shifting, skills are evolving, and reskilling is the new norm. Instead of worrying about the rise of intelligent machines, we must prepare for a new era-one that appreciates flexibility, lifelong learning, and the unique value only humans can deliver. Let’s discuss AI, automation, and augmentation, and their differences. Understanding the Difference: Automation vs. Augmentation A popular myth is that AI will replace humans entirely. But AI doesn’t necessarily replace people in totality; it replaces tasks. To thoroughly understand the effect of AI on the job market, we need to differentiate between automation and augmentation. Automation implies the complete transfer of tasks from humans to machines. It is most certain to affect work that is repetitive, rule-based, and predictable-dare we say data entry, straightforward accounting, or routine factory work? Augmentation, on the contrary, is the utilization of artificial intelligence to enhance and supplement the capabilities of human workers. Decision-making, creativity, emotional intelligence, or strategic thinking is jobs that are less prone to be replaced and more apt to be augmented by AI. Take the field of medicine, for example. Radiologists are not being replaced by AI-they’re using it to read scans more quickly and accurately. Teachers are not being removed from the classroom-they’re using AI software to personalize lesson plans and cater to different learning styles. In most industries, AI is a collaborator, not an adversary. A widely-quoted McKinsey report estimates 60% of occupations have at least 30% of activities automated, and less than 5% of occupations are completely automated. That means the great majority of people won’t be losing their jobs to AI; rather, their jobs will change. Jobs at Risk, Jobs on the Rise. AI Behind? So, what are the real jobs in risk? It’s not so much jobs as a whole, but tasks within a job. Anything that entails hand-to-keyboard repetitive or mechanical procedures, it data entry clerks, telemarketers, or even parts of customer service-can be threatened by automation. Yet most other jobs are not just safe-they’re growing: AI/ML Engineers Data Scientists Cybersecurity Analysts Cloud Computing Specialists Digital Transformation Officers AI Ethics and Compliance Officers Even traditionally “low-tech” jobs are evolving. Marketing professionals, for example, now need to learn about data analytics. HR personnel are using AI tools for smarter hiring and employee retention strategies. What counts as “technical” is expanding, and hybrid roles that combine human and technical skills are in great demand. The Rise of Reskilling and Lifelong Learning One of the most profound changes AI is bringing to the workplace is the new focus on up-skilling and reskilling. Skills have an ever-shortening half-life. A skill learned five years ago might be obsolete today. The World Economic Forum estimates that 50% of all workers will need reskilling by 2025. How does this work out in practical life? Educational Digital Platforms Large web-based open course platforms like Coursera, DataCamp, edX, and Udemy are thriving. Individuals are gaining certificates in cloud computing, AI development, project management, and data analytics-let alone coding skills-within a few months or weeks. Corporate Reskilling Programs Leading companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM are investing heavily in internal upskilling programs. Amazon, to cite an excellent example, invested more than $700 million in reskilling 100,000 employees in emerging skills like machine learning and cloud computing. Public Sector Initiatives A few governments are also taking early action. Examples are Singapore’s SkillsFuture and Finland’s AI education program for all, which illustrate the role policy can play in enabling citizens to adjust to technological change. The key takeaway? Lifelong learning is no longer a luxury-it’s a necessity. Human Strengths in the Age of AI As computers get better at doing logical and computational tasks, those things that make us uniquely human are all the more valuable. AI can perhaps do complex equations and pattern recognition at scale-but it still cannot replicate emotional intelligence, creativity, critical thinking, and moral discernment. That’s where human beings continue to surpass: Creativity & Innovation: Though AI can produce text, it is impossible to generate ideas of cultural or emotional significance. The nursing care of a nurse who demonstrates empathy or the counseling provided by an exemplary teacher cannot be substituted by any system. Ethical Decision-Making: AI operates within defined parameters; it is not capable of solving ethical problems without human involvement. Contextual Understanding: Humans can comprehend subtleties, humor, sarcasm, and cultural references that machines fail to catch. The future of employment transcends the mere acquisition of coding skills; it encompasses the ability to coexist and collaborate with machines, while simultaneously emphasizing the qualities that render us uniquely human. Adaptability: The Ultimate Career Skill In the AI era, the single most valuable skill is not technical skill-it’s adaptability. The individuals who will thrive will be the ones who can change, learn new tools, and continue to adapt. To present a real-world example, one can look at the revolution taking place in the journalism sector. Initially, there were concerns that artificially generated news stories would displace human reporters. But the reality is far more complex. Journalists are now utilizing AI tools to rapidly produce first drafts, track public opinion, and identify emerging trends. Consequently, this technology enables them to devote more time to investigating journalism and deeper reporting. Similarly, customer service roles are changing. Chatbots handle FAQs, and human reps focus on high-empathy, high-complexity situations. In logistics, warehouse automation is creating roles for robotics supervisors and systems analysts. Goodbye to the ancient adage-specialize in one thing and that’s it for life. The new motto is: “Stay curious, stay flexible, stay learning.” A Global Perspective It’s also important to mention that AI impacts vary by geography. In wealthy nations, the uptake of AI is faster, but so are investments in digital infrastructure and re-skilling. In poorer nations, there’s more likelihood of job displacement without a safety net. Yet, global organizations are now turning their attention to inclusive AI development. The OECD, World Economic Forum, and UNESCO are championing AI policies that leave no one behind-especially women, minority communities, and employees in vulnerable industries. Final Thoughts: It’s Not AI vs. Humans-It’s AI with Humans The fear that artificial intelligence will “take our jobs” ignores the complexity of the changes that are underway. Yes, the character of work is changing, but this change does not mean the elimination of human labor. Rather, we are forced to rethink our identities, form new competencies, and envision a future in which technology enhances our abilities instead of replacing us. Instead of asking, “Will AI replace my job?” a more appropriate question is: How do I implement artificial intelligence to enhance my work performance? The future of work will not be man versus machine-it will be about co-creation, collaboration, and continuous growth. So, who is being replaced, then? Not the people. However, human activities refuse to move forward. Have you ever wondered how Instagram seems to know exactly what reel you’d like next, or how your phone can recognize your face even when you’re smiling? It’s like these things just get you very well and know you so much (are our data being leaked....😅). Well, the secret to that magic is something that we call machine learning. It’s a technology sneaking its way into almost all aspects of our lives without us even realizing it. From the suggestions we get on social media to how doctors diagnose disease, machine learning is making the world around us work its magic. But what the question is, how does it do that, and where else is it being used? Let me help you break it down simply. What is Machine Learning? At its core, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn. Using ML, your PC can learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task, from math to reasoning and identifying objects. Instead of telling specific instructions to your computer to follow, like running a Python script to find a derivative of a number, we provide it with examples and let it figure it out by itself without us telling it. Additionally, the machine will learn based on the patterns it detects and understand itself based on what pattern it represents. Let’s think of it this way: rather than telling a computer step-by-step how to find a cat in a photo, we show it thousands of cat pictures and let it discover the visual patterns that make a cat a cat like its ears, whiskers, tail, and pointy ears. The machine will not be able to identify it in one shot, but as we show it thousands of photos of cats continuously, over time, the machine will start to learn the common patterns in the photo and can pick out a cat in a new photo based on the pattern it learned. How is Machine Learning Different from Traditional Programming? Traditional programming follows a straightforward approach: Input + Rules → Output Machine learning flips this process: Input + Output → Rules We give the system inputs (data) and desired outputs, and it learns the rules to transform one into the other. This is powerful because it means the computer can handle tasks that would be impossibly complex to code explicitly. Types of Machine Learning There are three main types: 1. Supervised Learning In supervised learning, we provide examples that are labeled. The machine learns to associate some inputs with some outputs. For example, to develop a spam filter, we might input an algorithm with hundreds of emails that are classified as “spam” or “not spam.” The algorithm learns about the features that distinguish spam mail from good mail. 2. Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning occurs when a model is trained on data without labels. The algorithm tries to learn the patterns or clusters within the data itself. Unsupervised learning can be employed by a retailer who wants to group customers into different categories based on what they buy without knowing beforehand what these groups will be. 3. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is a method whereby an agent is trained to make decisions based on the feedback provided by the environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for actions and learns to maximize rewards with time. This is how AlphaGo was instructed to play the board game of Go at the superhuman level, and robots learn to travel through intricate spaces. This is the reason why beating a chess bot is so hard, as it was trained under reinforcement learning. The Machine Learning Process A typical machine learning project follows these steps: Collect Data: Gather relevant data for your problem. Prepare Data: Clean and format the data so it’s usable. Choose a model: Select an appropriate algorithm for your task. Train the Model: Feed your data to the algorithm so it can learn patterns. Evaluate the Model: Test how well your model performs. Tune Parameters: Adjust settings so that they can improve performance. Make Predictions: Use your trained model on new data. Real-World Applications Machine learning powers many technologies we use daily: Virtual Assistants: Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use machine learning to understand and respond to voice commands. Recommendation Systems: Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon suggest content based on your preferences. Email Filtering: Gmail automatically sorts emails into primary, social, and promotional categories. Medical Diagnosis: Algorithms help doctors detect diseases from medical images. Fraud Detection: Banks use machine learning to identify suspicious transactions. Challenges in Machine Learning Despite its power, machine learning faces several challenges: Data Quality: Models are only as good as the data they’re trained on. Bias: If training data contains biases, the model will likely perpetuate them. Explainability: Complex models often function as “black boxes,” making it difficult to understand how they reach specific conclusions. Privacy Concerns: often requires large amounts of data, raising questions about data privacy. Getting Started with Machine Learning So now, if you’re interested in learning more about machine learning, here are some steps to get started: Learn the Basics: Understand fundamental concepts like algorithms, models, and evaluation metrics like how will your machine learn an image or predict, learn what models are there to train a machine learning model, and how to know if your machine is learning instead of mugging up everything. Study Statistics and Probability: These are the mathematical foundations of machine learning. Yup, math is needed to understand the algorithm I said too, so yes it is very important and we cannot skip this. Pick a Programming Language: Python is the most popular choice for machine learning due to its simplicity and robust libraries. Try Simple Projects: Start with beginner-friendly problems like predicting house prices or classifying images. You can use Kaggle to learn and do projects. Conclusion Machine learning is redefining how we solve issues in industries. By allowing computers to learn from data, we can solve complex problems that would be impossible with traditional programming techniques. The field is developing extremely rapidly, with new methods and applications consistently being discovered. If you’d like to integrate machine learning into your business or are considering doing so as a career, gaining an understanding of the fundamentals is the first step toward tapping its potential. As we advance into the future, machine learning will forever change our world in many exciting ways, making now a great time to dive into this cutting-edge technology. Nepal is experiencing a concealed economic transformation because it is transitioning from paper currency traditions toward digital financial management.

Introduction: In the world of computers and the internet, most people compete with Mac and Windows, just like comparing iOS and Android not knowing there is something known as Linux. If you are a tech student or one into computers, you might have heard about Linux somewhere. If you’re new to Linux and want to understand why it’s gaining popularity, then this guide, “Linux for Beginners” is for you. Linux is a powerful, secure, and open-source operating system that has become a viable alternative to Windows and macOS. Whether you’re a student, developer, or casual user, Linux offers flexibility and customization to suit your needs. But where have you used it is the question. Those who have not used Linux or maybe have heard it for the first time should know why it is one of the greatest fields to explore. And if you think that it has a great field then why is it not being known as an alternative to Windows and ios, well in reality Linux is used more than these actually, the majority of the world’s cloud computing servers are Linux based. It is a dominating OS for web servers, database servers, and other applications that power the majority of internet services. It is also used in embedded systems like smartwatches, Bluetooth speakers, thermostats cars, and many more. The Android that the majority of you talk about is based on Linux itself, not just that more than 500 computers are using Linux as their operating system, and hackers or expert programmers prefer Linux compared to other OS. So the question arises should we switch to Linux? Should we switch to Linux? We just talked about Linux being used by hackers and developers, not just that I also told you guys about Linux being used in the supercomputer so it means Linux is really fast and cool right? Well not exactly. The majority of Linux is perceived faster because there is no such bloatware like Windows and is lightweight compared to MacOS, so the majority of tasks might feel better in performance compared to other OS but this will depend on your system. I told you about the system cause Linux runs on almost anything and I mean it. Let me tell you more about its advantages. Reasons to Choose Linux Security and Privacy Unlike Mac and Windows, Linux is far secure with strong security features such as no such things as forced updates which are the most irritating things in the majority of OS, and no bloatware and spyware. Unlike other OS, Linux does not track its users and try to fetch their user data, Linux instead provides you full control over the system and lets you decide what to do. One fun thing about is that the majority of viruses in the world are designed for either Windows or MacOS so by default there are very less viruses ever designed that work on Linux making it more secure Open Source and Free: I just told you about how Linux gives us whole control and is transparent to us and this is what developers love about it and thus call it Open source as we can get to know how it was made and how to configure it all on the internet and all for free. So instead of paying for licenses for OS like Windows and macOS, we can just get Linux for free. Just being free makes this a great choice for students and budget-conscious users Performance and Efficiency I talked about hardware to you and why I brought it was because Linux can run on almost all hardware, Linux is lightweight and optimized for performance making it a great choice to revive your old laptop that becomes buggy and slow due to Windows. Just install Linux and feel it as if it’s new. Things to remember before Downloading Linux as a beginner to Linux Hardware Compatibility: Personally, when I downloaded Linux on old hardware there were no such issues like this but when I switched to new-gen laptops a lot of problems arose such as hardware not supporting, divrives not responding and the keyboard not functioning. These are common in Linux as the Linux you download is not fully built according to your laptop but in general consideration of what a simple device looks, so as you get more new gen computer you need to switch to better Linux or download all the hardware and drivers to the current Linux which might be quite hard for new users. Software compatibility: Not just hardware and drivers, so many software are not compatible with Linux too for instance majority of editing software like MS Office, Adobe Platform, and more are not available in Linux normally, we need to hardcode and download them from a third, and still it may not support fully. While Linux does provide you alternatives to this application they may not be that good as you are familiar with the original ones in Windows and MacOS Gaming While Linux gaming has come a long way, many major games still don’t support Linux natively, and you may need Wine or Proton (via Steam) to run Windows-based games, which isn’t always perfect and can require extra configuration. Learning Curve Linux has a steeper learning curve, especially if you’re used to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Windows or macOS. The majority of you have not used a terminal at all and the majority have a GUI for everything so switching from that is hard. You might have to use the terminal (command line) for certain tasks, and troubleshooting often requires technical knowledge. It requires more and more manual setup which might be hard for first-time users. A Ray of Hope For the Passionate Ones With so harsh truth about Linux majority of people have already given up using Linux, but is it bad? Can we use Linux despite these hurdles? Absolutely. And today, we’re here to shine a light on why Linux is still worth it. It may not be a smooth ride but a ride you will always cherish. We can solve most of these problems actually, firstly for driver hardware and software, we can choose a proper distro for this. What is a distro you say? So Linux has a lot of Operating Systems you can choose from each providing a collection of software packages such as system libraries, utilities, application software, and a desktop environment which makes each distro unique.

One technology that emerged and is in the process of revolutionizing how companies work is Robotic Process Automation. Starting with relieving the labor of frequent processes up to satisfactory customer experience, RPA seems to have been a proven game-changer across domains of businesses. What is Robotic Process Automation (RPA)? Thus, robotic process automation can also be understood as the use of software robots to take over the rule-based tasks that were earlier done by human beings. This often includes work such as feeding data, processing invoices, customer interactions, and generating reports. Whereas artificial intelligence is the branch of computer science that makes machines perform tasks and learn from them, RPA is used to deliver those pre-determined workflows accurately and consistently. How Robotic Process Automation is transforming businesses 1. Increased Efficiency and Productivity RPA’s most prevalent benefit is in the speed of execution and finalization of routine tasks, and without tiring. The bots can work 24/7 without breaks, something opposite to human employees. So, it will lead to a rise in productivity and result in lesser turnaround time. For example, an HR department using RPA could automate how an employee is onboarded to ease paperwork and free up time spent by the HR professionals working on strategic initiatives. 2. Cost Reduction In case the automation of manual operations takes place, a huge drop in labor costs is certain, and, of course, the other operational costs. A single RPA bot can work as well as many workers at a time but at a very reduced cost level. It’s not really about replacing humans with bots but it’s more about reallocating them against value-added tasks that carry greater levels of creativity, critical thinking, and problem resolution. 3. Improved Accuracy and Compliance Data entry and processing errors may turn out to be very costly and give rise to compliance challenges. RPA guarantees execution of tasks with complete accuracy to avoid any chances of errors and hence maintain regulatory compliance. In industries like banking and healthcare, adhering to strict regulatory compliance, an ability like RPA to ensure optimal conformance with rigid rules and procedures can therefore greatly benefit. 4. Enhanced Customer Experience Modern customers are always in a hurry and they want companies to deliver fast and frictionless experiences. RPA comes in handy in quickly investigating customer inquiries, ensuring seamless processing of transactions and offering real-time alerts. For example, in customer service with the help of chat-bot supported by RPA, client advice or refund or change is done on his account immediately-thus increasing customer experience. 5. Scalability and Flexibility As businesses grow, the complexity of processes also rises. This will greatly help organizations to scale their operations up just by adding more bots when required. Be it processing of orders during peak hours or processing thousands of invoices, RPA will be flexible to adapt to the needs of the business without making much of infrastructure shivers. Industries Benefiting from RPA In banking and finance, RPA automates tasks like account openings, KYC verification, fraud detection, and loan processing, enhancing efficiency. In healthcare, it streamlines managing patient records, billing, appointment scheduling, and insurance claims, reducing errors and administrative workload. Retail and e-commerce benefit from RPA by automating order processing, inventory management, customer support, and returns, improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. In manufacturing, RPA automates supply chain management, quality control, and vendor management, reducing errors and ensuring smooth operations. Challenges of Implementing RPA Despite its advantages, RPA implementation comes with challenges. The high initial investment can be significant, requiring careful ROI assessment. Employee resistance may arise from fears of job displacement, which can be mitigated by retraining and up-skilling the workforce. Selecting the right processes for automation is crucial, as not all tasks are suitable for RPA. Additionally, maintenance and updates are necessary to ensure bots stay aligned with changing business needs, preventing inefficiencies. The Future of RPA The future of RPA is incredibly promising, with advancements in AI and machine learning enabling even more intelligent automation. As RPA continues to evolve, businesses will move towards hyper-automation, where multiple technologies work together to create end-to-end automation solutions. In the coming years, we can expect RPA to integrate seamlessly with AI-driven analytics , chat-bots, and decision-making systems, further revolutionizing how businesses operate. Conclusion Robotic Process Automation is not just a passing trend-it is a transformational technology that is reshaping industries worldwide. By streamlining operations, reducing costs, and improving customer experiences, RPA has become an indispensable tool for businesses aiming to stay competitive in the digital age. Whether you’re a small business or a global enterprise, embracing RPA can unlock new levels of efficiency and innovation.

We can see a rapid change and an increase in bank fraud, cybercrime, and fraudulent transactions. It has impacted both individuals and businesses. Financial fraud has become a significant concern in Nepal. Financial institutions are having more difficulty identifying and stopping fraud. It is because of the growth of Internet transactions, mobile wallets, and digital banking. Utilizing cutting-edge methods like machine learning, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a weapon against financial crime. This blog examines the advantages, difficulties, and prospects of artificial intelligence in avoiding financial fraud in Nepal. Understanding Financial Fraud in Nepal The financial sector in Nepal is growing quickly, and fintech and digital banking are becoming more and more common. However, financial fraud has also increased because of this growth, and this includes: Identity theft: Criminals carry out fraudulent transactions using stolen personal data. Phishing scams: Con artists trick people into divulging private information. Money laundering: Lawful companies or banking channels are used to finance illicit funds. Unauthorized transactions and card skimming: When fraudsters obtain card information, they utilize it to make unlawful purchases. Loan fraud: Using fictitious identities or documents to apply for loans. Social Engineering Attacks: Using dishonest methods, scammers coerce victims into disclosing private information. These dishonest practices undermine public confidence in financial institutions and result in large financial losses. Sophisticated fraud strategies are becoming too difficult to detect using traditional methods that rely on rule-based systems and manual monitoring. AI is a game-changer in this situation. How AI Aids in the Fight Against Financial Fraud Instantaneous Fraud Identification Real-time transaction analysis is used by AI-powered fraud detection systems to spot questionable activity. To identify odd trends and flag possibly fraudulent transactions, machine learning models are trained on enormous volumes of historical transaction data. Identifying Anomalies Anomalies that differ from typical transaction behavior can be detected using AI algorithms. For example, the system can immediately flag a large foreign transaction for examination if a customer who often makes minor transactions suddenly starts one. Analytics for Prediction Based on historical patterns and consumer behaviour, AI can forecast possible fraud. Financial institutions can determine whether a transaction is likely to be fraudulent before it is executed by employing predictive modeling. Authentication via Biometrics Biometric authentication driven by AI, including voice recognition, fingerprint scanning, and facial recognition, improves security and guards against identity theft. Fraud Detection Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) To identify phishing attempts and fraudulent communications, AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) algorithms examine emails, messages, and phone conversations.

Nepal is starting to have some serious conversations about how to bring AI into both classrooms and courtrooms. Sounds great, right? Smarter learning, fewer court delays, and even fewer “lost” files at government offices. But before we start imagining an AI-powered utopia, let’s take a step back and ask: Are we actually ready for this? AI in Education : Smarter Learning or Just Smarter Cheating? There’s no doubt that AI could make education better-adaptive learning, instant feedback, automated grading. No more teachers drowning in piles of homework, no more students struggling to keep up in one-size-fits-all lessons. Sounds perfect. Except... we all know what’s actually going to happen. The minute AI becomes a classroom staple, half the students will be using it to actually learn , while the other half will figure out how to get ChatGPT to do their homework while they scroll TikTok. Teachers, instead of grading essays, will be busy trying to figure out if a real student wrote that beautifully worded analysis on Shakespeare-or if it was just AI flexing its literary muscles. At a recent consultation on AI in education, officials, tech experts, and educators sat down to discuss what this all means for Nepal. Baikuntha Prasad Aryal from the Ministry of Education pointed out that we need to integrate AI into schools now if we don’t want to fall behind. But it’s not as simple as flipping a switch. Nepal has to make sure AI is being used to bridge gaps , not widen them. Because if we’re not careful, we’ll end up in a situation where fancy private schools have AI-powered tutors while public schools are still struggling with basic internet access. Michael Croft from UNESCO put it best-if we don’t have a clear plan, we’ll be left with chaos. And honestly, Nepal has enough of that already. AI in the Courts: A Fix for Legal Backlogs or a Future of Robot Judges? Over in the legal world, AI is being pitched as the ultimate analytical person. Nepal’s court system has been drowning in backlogged cases for years , so AI could be a game changer. Imagine an AI-powered system organizing case files, scheduling hearings, and sorting through mountains of paperwork in seconds. The dream! But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. While AI is great at analyzing data, the law isn’t about data. It’s about human judgment, cultural context, and sometimes, the ability of a judge to stare at a witness until they crack under the pressure. Can AI do that? Probably not. And then there’s the issue of bias. AI is only as good as the data it learns from. If we feed it outdated, biased legal precedents, it’s just going to spit out decisions that reinforce the same old problems. Also, let’s not forget-Nepal’s legal system deals with some wild cases. Imagine an AI judge trying to settle a property dispute over a sacred cow . Would it suggest a fair legal rule, or would it just start Googling “cow ownership laws” and crash from confusion? Data security is another big concern. Nepal’s courts handle a lot of sensitive information. If AI systems aren’t built with proper safeguards, we could be looking at some serious privacy issues. The last thing we need is a legal database getting hacked and people’s private case details ending up who-knows-where . So, What’s the Plan? AI isn’t here to replace teachers or judges here to assist them. In schools, AI should make learning more engaging and personalized, not turn students into expert-level AI users who never actually study . In courts, AI should help speed up the system, not take over decision-making. Because the last thing Nepal needs is a court ruling delayed because the AI judge needed a software update . If we do this right, AI could genuinely make Nepal’s education and legal systems faster, smarter, and fairer . But if we rush in without a plan, we could be looking at a future where students don’t actually learn, and AI judges accidentally hand out life sentences for traffic violations . The future is exciting-but only if we don’t let AI run wild. Inspired by: UNESCO’s consultation on AI in Nepal’s education system and how it could change learning experiences. Discussions from the Kathmandu Post on AI’s potential role in the judiciary while keeping human judgment at the center. The very real possibility of students using AI to “study” without actually learning anything. The even bigger possibility of AI judges completely misinterpreting Nepal’s very complex legal system.

But not quite much in the banking sector. As smartphones are now available almost all over the country, it is no surprise that Artificial Intelligence is also starting to pop here. However, like technology, Nepal’s banking sector has been slower compared to other sectors. Banks in Nepal, while modernizing and adopting new techniques, are still hesitant to fully accept AI. This is mainly due to the terms of infrastructure regulation, and trust. But as Nepal’s financial services sector continues to evolve, AI offers multiple services: personalized services and many more. It also offers smarter risk management and more secure transaction processes. So let’s see and explore why the banking sector is slow in this trend. Similarly, let’s explore what opportunity this technology holds, and how we can benefit from this system. The Challenge of AI Adoption in Nepal’s Banking Sector Regulatory and Compliance Concerns Nepal’s banking system operates under a strict regulatory framework. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank of Nepal, closely monitors financial institutions. Additionally, it ensures the safety and security of customer deposits and financial systems. While there are regulations regarding AI being adopted globally at a slow pace, Nepal’s banking sector is particularly cautious. This is due to the lack of clear guidelines on how to implement AI technologies within the confines of its regulatory environment. For instance, the NRB’s existing regulation, which focuses mainly on traditional banking methods, might not fully be compatible with the data-driven nature of AI. With AI systems relying heavily on data, including sensitive customer information, its compliance with NEpal’s privacy act and others becomes even more complex. Therefore there is a rooted hesitation in implementing AI solutions as the main concern is data security and regulatory oversight. 1. Data Security and Privacy As said, Data Security remains a concerning topic and a top priority for Banks. As AI requires large datasets to function effectively, the risk of security breaches and data misuse is a growing concern. It is also to be noted that Nepal’s Banking system is often targeted by cybercriminals and this kind of news on people’s data being breached or leaked is common. To reduce this an AI should have a secure system to mitigate threats like fraud, hacking, and identity theft. In Nepal where the digital payment system is just a new innovative step compared to other countries who have already introduced this system years ago and yet still begot one or two problems in the well-established payment system we use today. Now, introducing AI to this field and trusting that AI’s ability to keep personal and financial data is very hard. To do this we will require time and a lot of data to train the model. Additionally meeting the demand of both customers and regulators in the process is also important. 2. Infrastructure and Legacy Systems Many banks in Nepal still operate on legacy traditional systems. The systems are not designed to integrate with the advanced features of AI. Unlike other countries where banks have new cutting-edge technology, Nepali financial institutions often operate on older core banking systems. The cost and risk of upgrading this system can be problematic, especially for smaller or regional banks. Additionally, the high quantity data for training ML models, is a hectic process here as majority of data collection , storage and sharing are oftenfragmented which creates another roadblock for Ai-driven solution. As a result, banks are very serious and cautious in the approach of Ai integration and monthly reluctant to overhaul the existing system that they are comfortable with. 3. Skill Gap AI itself is a new concept introduced in Nepal. The skills required to develop and manage AI are thus limited here. While there has been growth in the tech industry, the specialized knowledge needed to operate AI-driven tools. But in the banking sector or any other sector, such tools are quite limited. Data Scientists, machine learning engineers, and Ai specialists are in high demand globally, and Nepal’s banking sector faces the same shortage of talents. The Opportunities of AI in Nepal’s Banking Sector Despite these challenges, the potential for Ai in Nepal’s banking sector is huge, and here is how Ai can make a difference: 1. Personalized Banking Services The Nepalese banking sector focuses on customer service enhancement as mobile banking services expand their reach to residents of urban and rural Nepal. The implementation of AI enables Nepali banks to deliver customized products that specifically address the personal requirements of their individual customers. AI-powered chatbots provide round-the-clock customer support facilities that handle inquiries and transactions alongside personalized financial recommendations based on user spending behavior. The increase in Nepali consumers choosing mobile and digital banking platforms will drive escalated requirements for personalized banking services across the industry. AI systems examine financial records in combination with payment behaviors and societal indicators to customize financial services that let users improve their money management strategies. 2. Fraud Detection and Prevention The growth of digital banking across Nepal has produced intensified banking fraud cases affecting the industry. Artificial intelligence functions as a reliable instrument to both find and halt fraudulent behavior. AI leverages real-time transaction analysis through machine learning algorithms to spot unexpected spending activities which then allows it to notify bank customers or the institution before major financial losses occur. AI technology assists Nepali banks to discover credit card abuse together with money laundering and identity theft leading to enhanced cybersecurity protection. The implementation of AI would deliver necessary security measures when Nepali banks plan to expand their digital services. 3. Operational Efficiency Bank institutions throughout Nepal together with international financial institutions seek continuous methods to minimize operational costs and enhance operational efficiency. The implementation of AI solutions enables banks to execute repetitive duties like data recording together with loan analysis while running credit ratings besides checking against industry regulations. The implementation of AI leads banks to achieve better operational efficiency with reduced costs. The Nepalese banking system which maintains mostly manual and paper-intensive services can experience rapid progress thanks to AI applications. Benefits from this approach would improve the customer journey while simultaneously lowering both operational expenses and human-related service shortcomings. Conclusion The banking sector in Nepal is approaching an era of artificial intelligence transformation. The banking sector of Nepal faces ongoing challenges linked to regulatory checkpoints and limited infrastructure. In addition to the shortage of capable personnel but the promise of AI to enhance customer service and operations exists in direct proportion to its capacity to boost security measures. Future improvements in Nepal’s digital environment will make artificial intelligence essential for banking organizations. It will make us want to stay competitive while serving customers who use technology. The banking sector in Nepal will adapt AI capabilities at a moderate pace given that future prospects appear positive. If Nepal’s financial institutions establish plans, gain regulatory certainty and prioritize data security then they can use AI to develop an efficient banking system that is centered on customer needs and secured operations.

{"id": "sunway_95", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/low-resource-language-ocr-automation/", "title": "No Title", "content": "Low-Resource Language OCR: New Possibilities with AI Introduction Optical character recognition is the key to document process automation in today’s digital world, as it allows machines to read printed and handwritten texts. Although OCR has made significant progress in some major languages such as English, Chinese, and Spanish, it remains a great challenge to low-resource languages, which do not have a digital dataset of their own and NLP resources. This article will discover how recent AI and deep learning advancements are revolutionizing low-resource language OCR for low-resource languages. Its implementation in low-resource languages has remained only a dream until the recent advancement and breakthrough in AI and deep learning. This is going to bring a new possibility for OCR with low-resource languages, which may revolutionize the sectors of government documentation, historical text digitization, and financial automation in regions of these languages, and hence large-prevailing areas, among others. He then proceeds to explain the challenges of OCR in low-resource languages, elaborating on the very recent advancement in AI-driven OCR and how it is impacting automation across different industries. Understanding Low-Resource Languages in OCR What Are Low-Resource Languages? Low-resourced languages are those languages that normally lack large-scale annotated data, clean and robust linguistic resources (such as dictionaries and corpora), labeled training data, and, more than anything, powerful and well-supported research in computational linguistics. Some of the most famous examples are Nepali, Sinhala, and Amharic; in general, local, indigenous languages that do not have large communities developed around them. While languages such as English or Chinese have billions of texts available in digital form, such languages often suffer from a lack of labeled text data to train an OCR system. OCR and Its Role in Automation OCR is the technology to convert the hard-copy or scanned text into a machine-readable format. It’s applied in wide areas such as: Document digitization (scanning books, archives, historical records) Automated processing of invoices and receipts (financial automation) Automatic data entry in government and enterprise workflows Assistive support technologies like reading tools for the visually impaired OCR systems include Google Tesseract for high-resource languages, ABBYY FineReader, Amazon Textract, and several others. OCR systems like Google Tesseract work very well for high-resource languages. Still, for low-resource languages, the efficiency of the tools described above depends primarily on the data available and is therefore often associated with low accuracy because there is a scarcity of this data, combined with complex scripts and various handwriting styles. Challenges in OCR for Low-Resource Languages Lack of High-Quality Training Data OCR models inherently require thousands to millions of labeled text image pairs for effective training. In most low-resource languages, there is already a lack of digitized books, newspapers, etc., which further hampers training a good OCR model. Texts from books and newspapers available in low-resource languages are mostly turn of the century with highly deteriorated quality. It is, therefore, a big problem for the straightening and orderly OCR training model. Complex and Unique Scripts Written low-resource languages are generally non-Latin scripts, which pose a big challenge to any OCR engine. This might be associated with: Devanagari script (used in Nepali, Hindi, and Marathi) with character formations that are very tough Ethiopic script found in Amharic, which has many unique glyphs Also, Brahmic scripts are associated with ligatures and stacked letters. The traditional OCR models fail to yield good results on these scripts, especially when it comes to recognizing handwritten text. Poorly Scanned, Noisy Data Most of the documents written in low-resource languages have been scanned from deteriorated, old, and dirty sources and could have ink smudges, faded text, torn pages, or mixed text of different languages within the same document. Some of them may not have uniform font or space, which will make the OCR system much less accurate compared to those in high-resource languages. Lack of NLP Support for Post-Processing OCR is sometimes dependent on the NLP models, which help in better output correction for spell and grammar checking, etc. Since low-resourced languages suffer from the problem of missing pre-trained NLP models, OCR systems often fail to correct errors in the extracted text effectively. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning: The New Wave in OCR Automation The use of deep learning research in OCR models supported by artificial intelligence has been engaged in automating text extraction in under-resourced languages. This is one of the main methods they achieve this. Self-Supervised and Few-Shot Learning Instead of having to depend on huge labeled datasets, the AI models are now learning by being: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-The models learn from unlabelled data in large corpora at the input level like raw text or images. Few-Shot Learning-is to learn patterns based on very small data points, of course, instrumental for rare languages, an example of it being Facebook’s SeamlessM4T model using self-supervised learning to enhance multilingual text recognition - even in languages with less data. Advanced techniques - Transformer-Based OCR Models In the earlier days, OCRs used to be either rule-based or statistical. The modern OCR engines now have transformer models like Tesseract 5.0, TrOCR (pre-trains on high-resource languages and fine-tunes for low-resource languages) from Microsoft, and PaddleOCR (allows users to train custom models for rare scripts). Data Augmentation Techniques Some data augmentation strategies applied by the researchers due to limited labeled datasets include: GANs for generating synthetic data of text images in low-resource languages Rotating, distorting, or blurring text images in the training data to enhance the robustness of OCR. Example: Working on the Sanskrit OCR Project at Google involved extensive work to fix character recognition in ancient manuscripts, for which synthetic text generation had to be used. Cloud OCR Approaches and Edge OCR Enterprises are implementing OCR engines with cloud and mobile edge-computing solutions to enable more universally accessible OCR. Cloud-based OCR services-Google Vision API, and Microsoft Azure OCR-have added support for more low-resource languages. Edge computing enables OCR models on low-power devices, such as smartphones, to automate at scale Ways to Automate OCR in Low-Resource Languages Since AI-OCR is getting strengthened, there are a few significant ways in which OCR can drive automation: In the Federal and Public Administration: Decision-making statement automation for the process of paper-based documents for office work Birth certificates, records of land, and legal forms got scanned to keep in digital format Facilitated automatic document verification to assess citizens in remote areas. In Finance and Banking OCR can process invoices in cheques and in any local language. Digitization of receipts and tax documents for small businesses Preservation of Historical and Cultural OCR proves helpful for scanning old manuscripts and digitizing them; therefore, they can be preserved. OCR helps preserve old texts and manuscripts by conversion to a digital format, thus preserving endangered languages and cultures. AI Assistants and Chatbots OCR can extract the content of documents to power assistant-driven AI. Translate handwritten content into any language The Future of OCR in Low-Resource Languages It has been noted that AI and deep learning have opened up new possibilities for OCR in low-resource languages where automation was not so easy. While the challenges stay-limited datasets, script complexity, and noisy input-new techniques are coming up to improve the accuracy of the procedure. As OCR for low-resource languages gets more reliable, this will allow for the automation of government services, financial processing, cultural preservation, and educational fields. It is this technology that is going to bridge the digital gap by relaying all languages, no matter how rare they are, into beneficiaries of the power of AI-driven automation. This technology is going to be the start of a brand new future where all languages, no matter how rare, are going to benefit from the power of AI-driven automation. The future of OCR is not only with reading text but with digitalizing every language. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

{"id": "sunway_96", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/biometric-security-privacy-risks/", "title": "No Title", "content": "Biometric Authentication: The Future of Cyber Security or Risk? At the moment cyber-attacks along with data breaches are growing more and more sophisticated by the day. The search for new ways of protecting our very own personal data has never been more critical. Cue biometric authentication new technology is a game-changer in the cyber security field. Spanning from fingerprinting to face scanning and iris scanning, biometric security solutions present a more secure and more convenient alternative. It is replacing and working as an alternative of passwords and PINs. However, as with any emerging tech, the use of biometrics raises serious privacy issues. Additionally, it also raised ethical questions regarding the overall use of biometrics. The Era of Biometric Security (Biometric Authentication) Biometrics is the act of recording our unique physical characteristics. Additionally, it might be a fingerprint, the contours of our face. It also may be the hue of the iris, for instance, we can use it as a form of identification. It is pilfered or lost. Biometrics is an authentication that physically ties to the biology of a human person. Biometric authentication is hard to duplicate. Facial recognition has been so popular because it is easy to use and easy to implement on daily devices. Phones, laptops, and even residential security systems use facial recognition to provide access. Today, it is also an easy and convenient method for consumers to unlock devices. Similarly, fingerprint readers, now ubiquitous on smartphones, are integrated into larger platforms. This will offer a secure and convenient method of verification. Similarly, for even more forward thinkers, there is iris scan technology. The technology provides yet another layer of security, imaging the patterns unique to the eye’s iris to verify identities. These technologies are widely viewed as a possible answer to the long-standing issue of password management. As cyber-attacks become more advanced password files get compromised daily. This leads users to find it difficult to practice good security hygiene. With biometrics, users should not remember complex combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols-they only need to be themselves. The Promise of Biometrics for Online Security The biggest advantage of biometric authentication is being able to create an even higher level of security. Passwords are either weak, used on more than one website, or just plain guessed easily. People use simple phrases or information easily found on the web. Biometrics are much more difficult to replicate. Even if the hacker manages to get your password or PIN, they would require your unique biological characteristics to breach the system. Furthermore, biometric systems are fast and convenient. Opening one’s phone with a quick scan of the individual’s fingerprint or glancing at one’s phone for facial scanning is normal. This kind of convenience can come with the ability to remove a significant amount of friction from users, allowing them to safely log in to online services without having to recall passwords or undergo multiple-step authentication processes. Furthermore, biometric systems can be multi-factor in nature. For instance, a device can require both a fingerprint and a face scan, which adds a layer of protection that isn’t possible with passwords. Since online threats are not demonstrating any indication of decelerating, layered security in the form of biometrics could prove to be one of the most robust protections on hand to combat cybercrime. Privacy Concerns: The Dark Side of Biometric Data For all their potential benefits, biometric systems aren’t without some very legitimate concerns of all of which are those having to do with privacy. Biometric authentication captures and stores a person’s own biological data by its very nature. Unlike a password, which we can change if someone compromises it, we cannot change our fingerprint, face, or iris. Because they are fixed and permanent. If hackers steal or someone mismanages that data, the consequences can be much worse One of the greatest risks is centralized biometric storage. When we login with biometrics, the information is kept on a server or in the cloud. When these databases are compromised by the attackers, they will not just obtain usernames and passwords but also very personal and irreversible data. Unwanted access to this kind of sensitive data could lead to identity theft, fraud, or blackmail. Another concern is the use of surveillance. Facial recognition software has been specifically aimed at application in public areas where people are unaware of being photographed. Governments and non-governmental agencies are using the systems to monitor individuals’ movements, activities, and even political affiliations. Though proponents have argued that it can be used in ways that might make us safer (e.g., to arrest criminals or deter terrorist attacks), others view it as an insidious threat to privacy and a tool for totalitarian oppression. In addition, their accuracy is an issue as well. They can have false positives and false negatives, thus giving unauthorized individuals access or not giving authorized individuals access. The study has determined that facial recognition software, for instance, has been found to operate at a higher rate of errors in identifying females and minorities, bringing about issues regarding the fairness and reliability of these technologies. Balancing Security and Privacy As with any technology progress, the issue with turning biometric authentication into a success is achieving the correct balance between security and privacy. To prevent such systems from being an evil empire, there must be strict regulation and protection mechanisms. Biometric information is encrypted and protected, and people should be in a position to delete or revoke access to their information at their discretion. Transparency about collection and usage of the biometric information will be most important to win consumers’ trust. The second important step is to design biometric systems that are equitable. The developers need to remove biases in facial recognition and other biometric systems so that they function as equally effectively with all populations of people. This will prevent discrimination. similarly, it also makes the population discriminatorily untargeted or excluded by the system. Last, users must be cognizant and careful of the technologies used. With any authentication method, it is intelligent to be knowledgeable of the risks and take measures to protect personal data. Whether activating multi-factor authentication, using encrypted apps, or selecting services with better privacy settings, users have to do something when it pertains to their cyber security. Conclusion: The Future of Biometric Authentication Biometric authentication is quite possibly the key to the cyber security revolution, with newer, quicker, safer methods of access to our data. Going forward, as technology will undoubtedly continue to improve, even new methods of authentication will emerge, such as voice or even DNA scanning. With all of the innovation, however, we need to be careful not to miss the privacy risk. Finally, the future of biometric security will be in our own hands, as we decide to balance the delicate trade-off between convenience, security, and privacy. With regulatory control, ethical innovation, and transparency as a priority, biometric authentication could well be the answer to a safer online existence. But with every innovation, we must move cautiously lest we mortgage privacy on the altar of convenience in a way we would later regret.

{"id": "sunway_97", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/why-developers-love-rust/", "title": "No Title", "content": "Rise of Rust: Why Developer loves It? Over the past ten years, Rust grew from an experimental project to one of the globe’s best-loved programming languages. Stack Overflow polls have demonstrated its popularity among programmers every year. It has consistently ranked as the ‘most loved’ language for several consecutive years. But are programmers truly so in love with this language? Why do engineers-from amateurs to industrial-scale professionals-keep choosing this language? Especially when so many others are competing in the same space?Today’s blog will delve into what makes this language so popular, its standout features, and how it has been able to etch itself a distinctive niche in contemporary software development. A Brief History Rust was a side project from Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare in 2006. A developer started Rust as a side project, and Mozilla gained enough interest in it to formally sponsor it The goal was to create a language that was highly performing with high safety guarantees, especially in regard to memory safety. After years of development, developers finally launched Rust 1.0 in 2015. Since then, various companies and communities have used it to achieve reliability without sacrificing speed. Why Developers are Loving It 1. Memory Safety Without a Garbage Collector One of the main attractions of Rust is that it has built a novel and fresh method for addressing memory. Whereas with C and C++ the memory is assigned and reclaimed manually by the developer, or in Java and Python it relies on garbage collection, Rust makes use of the model of ownership. With this system, memory is both effectively and safely managed at compile time, removing classes of typical bugs like null pointer dereferences, use-after-free, and data races. By enforcing borrowing and ownership rules strictly, Rust eliminates an entire class of bugs that are notoriously difficult to debug in other languages. That means fewer segmentation faults and no time wasted hunting for memory leaks. 2. Performance Comparable to C and C++ Rust is a compiled language that produces very optimized machine code and is near to C and C++ performance. As speedy as it is, it’s a top contender for system programming, game development, and other performance-critical applications. In contrast to garbage collection-halting languages, Rust provides deterministic runtime behavior and is therefore an ideal candidate for latency-critical applications. 3. Fearless Concurrency Concurrency is likely the most challenging area of contemporary software development. Rust’s ownership model extends to concurrency programming, where data races are detected at compile-time instead of leading to undefined behavior at runtime. The language enables one to use high-level abstractions like threads, async programming, and message-passing concurrency safely. 4. Developer-Friendly Tooling Rust’s ecosystem has a wealth of top-quality tools to enhance development. Cargo: Rust’s build system and dependency manager enable simple dependency management and compilation. Clippy: A built-in linting feature that catches common errors. Rustfmt: Helps enforce consistent code appearance across teams. Documentation Generation: Rust’s built-in documentation system makes it easy to generate well-structured docs directly from code comments. These tools assist in giving a more complete developer experience, so Rust is not just able but also enjoyable to work with. 5. Strong and Supportive Community The Rust community is famous for being friendly and helpful. The official Rust forums, Discord channels, and Reddit discussions are occupied by programmers who willingly share their knowledge. The programming language also enjoys a strong mentorship program and well-written documentation, making it easier to learn for newcomers. A Language Designed for Modern Development Rust was created with issues of modern software development in mind. Whether web assembly, embedded systems, or cloud-native applications, Rust has facets that appeal well to the demands of the day. With corporations such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google researching Rust for some of their projects, it’s clear that language will be part of future software development. Where It Is Being Used Web Development While Rust is not a traditional web development language, libraries like Rocket and Actix-web allow developers to build high-performance, secure web applications. Rust’s performance and safety make it an excellent backend language, especially when handling high-concurrency workloads. Embedded Systems Because of its low-level control and safety guarantees, Rust is becoming a popular choice for embedded programming. Companies working on firmware, IoT, and real-time operating systems are adopting Rust for its reliability and performance. Game Development Programmers need a language that combines speed with security. Rust offers both of them, along with libraries like Bevy and Amethyst that provide game development functionality similar to Unity or Unreal Engine. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Rust has been adopted by the likes of Solana and Polkadot because it is safe, fast, and can handle difficult concurrent operations. The correctness focus that the language is designed on also renders it a suitable choice for blockchain development whose security is of paramount importance. Operating Systems and Systems Programming Rust is also gaining popularity in systems programming. There even exist full-fledged operating systems written in Rust, such as the Redox OS. Microsoft even went far enough to experiment with re-compiling some elements of Windows with Rust for reasons of security and stability. Challenges of Learning Rust Despite its advantages, Rust is not without a learning curve. Developers who come from languages like Python or JavaScript do indeed struggle with Rust’s strict compiler rules and ownership model at first. Yet, once mastered, developers appreciate the power these give to code quality and security. Another difficulty is that Rust’s ecosystem while growing, is not yet as mature as more established languages such as Python or Java. Some libraries may not have the same level of documentation or support, but this is rapidly evolving as the language is used by more individuals. Is Rust the Future of Programming? Rust’s continuing development and adoption across use cases in various industries shows that Rust will reign over programming in the coming years. Its prowess at delivering safety without infringing on performance presents Rust as an excellent opportunity as a current form of software programming. As more companies tap into the positive aspect of applying Rust, the greater the chances are that future years will hold more extensive uses of it. If you’re a programmer looking to increase the value of your skills and safeguard your future career, studying Rust can be one of the best things you can do. Whether you’re building web apps, embedded systems, or high-performance software, Rust offers a mix of safety, performance, and programmer-centric features that few languages can equal. Final Thoughts Rust has turned into a force of revolution in the programming world. With its performance-focused and safe nature, supported by an open and growing community, it is a language with gigantic potential. Its rather steep learning curve aside, its long-term benefit in terms of code stability, concurrency safety, and system performance is gigantic. As companies continue to look out for solutions that are both scalable and secure, Rust’s value is going to grow steadily. Overall, Rust is not just a trend but also shows a larger shift towards the way applications are built nowadays. Its philosophy and its elements match quite well with the changing business and developer priorities, and as such, it is something that has to be seriously considered in the coming years.

These concepts are way more critical than you think. For instance, do you know LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek play with embeddings to understand your prompts? The ability to understand prompts dramatically depends on the quality of embeddings. Let’s explore why. In this article we will discuss about Embeddings and Embedding. What are Embeddings? In simple terms, embeddings are vector representations in a vector space. Embeddings are not limited to words, they can be of other inputs like sentences, images, and graphs. Embeddings represent high-dimensional data like texts and images into vectors of low dimension. With this, the task of processing this complex data becomes easier for models that only understand continuous numbers. Vectors are the key here. In computer science, vectors are represented in an array where [a] is a 1-dimensional vector, [a, b] is 2-dimensional, and so on. From a mathematical view, vectors can be added, which applies to embeddings too. Just like adding vectors gives us other vectors, adding embeddings will provide another embedding. Types of Embeddings: Word Embeddings: Word embeddings are vector representations of words in a vector space where each words are given a vector. In the vector space, related words are close to each other. Let’s say if “man” is represented with [0.5, 5.5, -0.7]. Since man and woman are semantically similar words, “woman” would have a vector embedding similar to it. Also, hereby performing arithmetic operations on such vectors, we can attain similar vectors. E.g “king” - “man” + “woman” = “queen”. Some popular models for word embeddings are Word2vec, GloVe, and FastText. Sentence Embeddings: Sentence embeddings are vector representations of whole sentences. Unlike word embeddings, the whole sentence is mapped in a vector space, and semantically similar sentences are closer in the vector space. Models like InferSent, and Doc2vec(extension of Word2vec) are used to generate sentence embeddings. Image Embeddings: Images can also be transformed into vectors, that is exactly what you’ll call image embeddings. CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are best for generating image embeddings, which are later used for tasks like image classification and image retrieval. Audio and speech Embeddings: Audio and speech embeddings are generated by converting the raw audio and speech data into vectors that can be suitable for tasks like speech recognition and emotion detection. VGGish and Wav2vect are models dedicated to such embeddings. Why do we need Embeddings? The problem with raw, categorical, or high-dimensional data Before embeddings were ubiquitous, encoding techniques like one-hot encoding were used to represent categorical variables. However, this technique has limitations. Let’s say we have a small vocabulary of 5 words: “ Cat “, “ dog “, “ fish “, “ bird “, “ horse “ One-hot encoding works by generating a binary representation for each class where the position corresponding to the word is represented by 1. So we get a representation similar to the table below. Such representations are called sparse vectors, and these were the foundations for early word embedding techniques. So this works fine for a small number of classes, but what if we have all the words in the English language? How big will this table be? So big that the computation will be too high and messy. Not only that, while extracting the semantics out of words, the model will be confused. This problem is solved by embeddings, which are also called dense vectors. The embeddings not only numerically represent but are also able to capture the semantics of words by introducing a distance concept where words with similar semantics have a very small distance. For similarity measurements, cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and several others can be used. Real World Applications Embeddings have become foundational across NLP, recommendation systems, and computer vision. Their power lies in transforming raw, high-dimensional data into dense vectors that encode contextual, semantic, or behavioral relationships, enabling machines to reason more effectively about language, users, and visual content. Text Search: Embeddings are key for any retrieval tasks that involve retrieving similar documents based on a given query. Embeddings and embedding models are a crucial part of the RAG( Retrieval Augmented Generation) architecture, which is a great approach to prevent LLMs from hallucination. Recommendation system: In a recommendation system, whether it’s for movies, food, or clothes, embedding models are used to represent them in vectors. They are stored in a vector space and can be compared to recommend similar ones. Sentiment Analysis: Sentiments are very abstract for models to detect, but using embeddings and capturing sentiment-related features can ease the process. Positive words or sentences have similar embeddings, which can differentiate them from negative word embeddings. Evolution of Embedding Models From one-hot to word2vec: One-hot encoding was the most primitive way of representing words in a vector, where only the corresponding word was represented as one and others as zeros. This approach was succeeded by TF-IDF (Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency) in an attempt to capture the importance of words based on their frequency in a document(sentences or phrases) and across all the documents. Sparck Jones proposed it in his paper “A Statistical Interpretation of term specificity and its application in retrieval.” TF-IDF captured more useful information than one-hot encoding, but still could not capture the semantics. Word2vec was a revolutionary technique first proposed in a paper titled “Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space”. It was suggested by Tomas Mikolov and colleagues at Google and published in 2013. Similalry, it uses a shallow neural network to capture the linguistic context of words from a large corpus of text. It produces an embedding that maps words to a vector space, typically of a few hundred dimensions. Cosine Similarity is used to measure the similarity between the embeddings. Static Vs Contextual Embedding Models Models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText are effective at generating dense vector representations of words, known as embeddings, which capture semantic relationships. Word2Vec, in particular, learns these embeddings using one of two architectures: CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) or Skip-gram. However, the embeddings produced by these models are static, meaning each word has a single representation regardless of context. As a result, they struggle with polysemy-where a word has multiple meanings. For example, they cannot distinguish between the word bat in the sentences: “He bought a new bat to play cricket.” “Bat flies at night.” Contextual nuances are lost because the embedding is based solely on word co-occurrence statistics in a fixed window of text, rather than the full context of a sentence. In such scenarios, a contextualized model like BERT( Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) excels where word embeddings are generated based on the context of surrounding words. BERT’s bidirectionality allows it to look for context at both the left and right context of a word during training. So, the embeddings BERT produces are contextual, that is, words can have different embeddings based on their context. This makes it very powerful in generating robust embeddings that can retain contextualized semantics. Key Challenges and Limitations Embedding models is a game-changing concept, but it has ethical considerations. The models may learn the bias in the training data that can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in their applications. So, realizing and mitigating such bias becomes a crucial part of developing a safe and ethical AI system. Bias in Embeddings: Textual data that human produces are inherently biased. So, while training embedding models to learn the semantics and contexts, such bias gets slipped. A common example is associating “doctors” with males and “nurses” with females, reflecting societal stereotypes. These biases can lead to unfairness and discrimination in real-world applications like a recommendation system or a hiring system. To mitigate such biases, techniques like debiasing embeddings can be adapted, which remove or neutralize biased dimensions. Regular testing for bias and fairness while introducing diverse and representative training data is a must. Transparency and Accountability: Transparency and accountability are another aspect that needs to be considered while dealing with embedding models. The advanced embedding model represents data in dimensions that range in the hundreds, which is incomprehensible and affects the outcomes of AI systems. Hence, developers should focus on being transparent about training data and the choice of models. Conclusion Embedding models are the cornerstone of modern AI that allows powerful models to process high dimensional data which was previously impossible. The evolution of word embeddings from Word2Vect and GloVe to state-of-the-art models like BERT and GPT has enabled new possibilities in NLP, computer vision, and recommendation systems. As current models start to evolve and shape the world, it becomes inevitable to understand embedding models. Understanding their use cases equips us to build powerful AI systems that transform conventional tasks. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

{"id": "sunway_99", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/the-ai-dilemma-for-junior-developers-a-shortcut-or-a-learning-roadblock/", "title": "No Title", "content": "Artificial Intelligence Dilemma : Shortcut or Roadblock? Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a hot topic in the tech industry, with opinions ranging from it being a revolutionary boom to a potential doom. It has raised a big question: Artificial Intelligence dilemma, a shortcut or a Roadblock? AI has undeniably transformed the field of technology, significantly speeding up development processes. Before the advent of Artificial Intelligence(AI) tools, developing a full-stack web application could take over a month. Now, with clear requirements, it can be accomplished in less than a week. This acceleration is indeed fascinating, especially for senior developers who can leverage AI to enhance their productivity. However, the impact of AI on junior developers is a different story. While AI tools offer a quick path to creating sophisticated applications, they also pose a significant risk: over-reliance. Junior developers, who are just entering the tech field, may become too dependent on these tools, potentially hindering their long-term growth and understanding of fundamental concepts. The Artificial Intelligence Dilemma: Efficiency vs. Learning Imagine two developers, a junior and a senior tasked with building a full-stack e-commerce web application. The junior developer is allowed to use any AI tool, while the senior developer must rely solely on their technical skills, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and other resources. Initially, the junior developer’s application might appear more polished and feature-rich. However, the true test comes when both are asked to make small changes without the aid of AI tools. The junior developer, accustomed to AI assistance, might struggle to implement these changes efficiently and bug-free. In contrast, the senior developer, with a deep understanding of the fundamentals, can make the necessary adjustments smoothly. This scenario highlights a critical issue: Junior developers may be skipping essential learning steps by relying too heavily on AI tools. The Importance of Fundamentals One of the major problems observed in junior developers today is a lack of interest in learning the fundamentals. They often want to jump straight into advanced topics and tools without building a strong foundation. This approach can lead to a superficial understanding of technology, making it difficult to troubleshoot issues or adapt to new challenges without AI assistance. The Future of Software Development Despite the concerns, it’s unlikely that software developers or engineers will lose their jobs to AI. Instead, Artificial Intelligence will likely change the workflow, making processes more efficient. The role of a software engineer might evolve, but it won’t be replaced by AI entirely. The idea of “Software Engineer 2.0” being synonymous with “Machine Learning Engineer” is a misconception. The future will still require developers with a solid grasp of fundamentals, who can use AI tools as an enhancement rather than a crutch. Adapting to the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven workforce A recent study conducted by Pearson, in partnership with ServiceNow, provides an extensive analysis of the potential effects of AI and automation on the economies of six countries (U.S., UK, Germany, India, Australia, and Japan) and how technology-based roles are expected to evolve. Despite concern from potentially affected groups, this research shows that junior application developers will remain valuable even as AI continues to evolve. The study suggests that in the coming years, those junior developers who can understand and adapt to their new roles will be best prepared to thrive in the AI-driven workforce of the future. The rise of AI and automation significantly impacts the skills required for junior developers to succeed in the tech industry. By analyzing their workflows and identifying areas where automation can provide the most significant value, developers can implement automation tools and processes, freeing time for more complex work. Project-based learning is a popular and effective way for new developers to gain hands-on experience and apply their coding skills to real-world challenges. However, this approach also presents its own set of unique challenges. Many new developers encounter pitfalls, but mastering code quality can set them apart in a competitive industry. Conclusion AI tools offer tremendous potential for accelerating development and enhancing productivity. However, for junior developers, over-reliance on these tools can be a double-edged sword. While they provide a quick path to creating complex applications, they can also hinder the learning of essential fundamentals. The key is to strike a balance: use AI tools to augment your skills, but never at the expense of understanding the core principles of software development. By doing so, junior developers can grow into well-rounded, competent professionals capable of adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

{"id": "sunway_100", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/the-future-of-ai-in-healthcare-challenges-and-ethical-concerns-2/", "title": "No Title", "content": "AI in Healthcare: Challenges and Ethical Concerns Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer Sci-Fi, it’s here, transforming industries, and AI in healthcare is one of the most promising yet complex domains it’s reshaping. From detecting cancer in medical scans to predicting strokes before they occur, AI has the potential to make healthcare faster, more efficient, and more precise. But alongside these advancements come technical hurdles, ethical dilemmas, and critical questions about how much control we should give to algorithms in life-and-death decisions. So, what does the future of AI in healthcare look like? Let’s explore. The Promise of AI in Healthcare AI in medicine is like having a supercharged doctor with a photographic memory and lightning-fast thinking. It’s already changing the game, spotting diseases like Alzheimer’s and breast cancer earlier and more accurately than ever. Hospitals are using AI to cut down ER wait times and manage resources better, while in drug discovery, breakthroughs like DeepMind’s AlphaFold are rewriting the rules of protein research. Imagine taking a pill crafted exclusively for you designed to target your condition with laser precision, minimize side effects, and accelerate recovery. That’s the promise of personalized medicine. At a biomedical hackathon at Kathmandu University, I got a deep dive into human genetics and discovered how genetic sequencing, protein interactions, and biomarker analysis could unlock this future. Of course, challenges like data privacy and algorithmic bias remain, but one thing is clear-AI is revolutionizing healthcare in the best way possible. Key Challenges in Implementation of AI in HealthCare With great power comes great responsibility-and AI in healthcare is the Spider-Man of modern medicine. It’s got all this dazzling potential, but sorry, folks, it’s not as easy as flicking an “on” switch and calling it a day. AI depends on vast amounts of high-quality data, but medical records are often scattered, incomplete, or trapped in outdated systems. When AI feeds on bad data, it produces unreliable predictions, leading to potential misdiagnoses and treatment errors. The challenge isn’t just collecting data but ensuring it is accurate, standardized, and accessible. Then there’s the cost challenge. Developing and implementing AI isn’t inexpensive-it takes a significant investment for hospitals to bring it on board. Smaller clinics and less-funded regions often can’t keep up, watching from the sidelines as larger institutions adopt the technology. This isn’t just unfortunate-it could deepen the gap in healthcare access, where advanced AI tools are mostly available to well-resourced facilities. Patient care shouldn’t feel exclusive, should it? Then there’s the issue of trust. Doctors aren’t always eager to embrace algorithms-they’ve spent years building their expertise through hands-on experience, not managing software. Many view AI with skepticism, unsure of its role in their practice. Without thorough training and clear evidence that AI supports rather than replaces their judgment, adoption will likely remain gradual. AI’s role in healthcare must be that of an assistant, not an authority-augmenting human expertise rather than attempting to replace it. The potential? Oh, it’s huge -AI could be the rockstar of healthcare. But if we don’t tackle these hiccups, it might just end up as another overhyped gadget gathering dust in the corner. Ethical Concerns Beyond technical and financial barriers, AI in healthcare raises serious ethical questions. Let’s ensure this revolution succeeds, time to address the challenges thoughtfully and focus on effective solutions! Privacy and Data Security AI requires access to extensive patient data to function effectively, but this poses risks. Medical records contain highly sensitive information-who controls access, and how can we ensure data remains secure? Patients deserve transparency and strict safeguards against breaches or misuse. Bias and Fairness AI systems learn from old data, and sometimes that data has a few sneaky flaws. If it shortchanges certain groups, the AI might not treat everyone fairly. Case in point: one fancy AI once underestimated Black patients’ needs because it was fed healthcare spending stats that weren’t quite balanced. Fixing these little hiccups is a must to keep AI healthcare fair for all. Accountability and Trust When AI makes a medical error, who is responsible-the doctor, the developer, or the algorithm itself? Unlike human professionals, AI cannot explain its reasoning in a way we always understand, making accountability difficult. Trust in AI requires transparency, rigorous testing, and the ability for healthcare providers to interpret and validate AI recommendations. NeuroVision: A Case Study in Responsible AI Development One project that highlights AI’s potential, when developed responsibly, is NeuroVision. This initiative uses AI to classify brain tumors from DICOM medical images, based on a proposed technical architecture that integrates deep learning models with cloud-based processing for improved speed and accuracy. The dataset for this system is developed using Functional APIs, which enable efficient handling and structuring of complex medical imaging data. If implemented with proper ethical considerations, it could significantly enhance early tumor detection, leading to faster diagnoses and improved treatment planning. However, for NeuroVision to succeed ethically, several factors must be addressed: Data Transparency & Security : Ensuring patient imaging data is handled with the highest standards of encryption and privacy protection. Bias Mitigation : Training the model on diverse datasets to avoid racial, gender, or socioeconomic disparities in diagnosis. Explainability : Implementing explainable AI (XAI) techniques to help radiologists understand why the AI reached a particular conclusion, rather than treating it as a “black box.” Collaboration with Medical Experts : Ensuring that NeuroVision remains a tool that assists radiologists rather than replaces them, maintaining human oversight in critical decisions. If developed with these ethical pillars in mind, NeuroVision could set an example for responsible AI integration in healthcare, proving that innovation and responsibility can go hand in hand. The Road Ahead: Balancing Innovation and Responsibility The future of AI in healthcare all comes down to finding that sweet spot. We need strong rules to make sure AI plays fair, owns up to its mistakes, and keeps our data safe. And let’s be real-transparency matters. If patients and doctors can’t figure out how AI comes up with its answers, they’re not going to trust it, plain and simple. The trick is teamwork. AI techies, doctors, ethicists, and policymakers have to join forces to build systems that aren’t just cutting-edge but also decent and focused on people. Think of it like a three-legged stool: you’ve got innovation, responsibility, and trust holding it up. Kick one out, and the whole thing comes crashing down. The good news? We’re already seeing some wins. A few hospitals are testing out AI that explains itself, governments are sketching out ethics rules, and researchers are digging into the messy stuff like bias and fairness. Still, we’ve got a ways to go-nobody said this would be a quick fix! Conclusion AI could shake up healthcare-think of quicker diagnoses, sharper treatments, and healthier vibes all around. But let’s not kid ourselves: tech isn’t some magic fix-it wand. It’s more like a trusty tool, and we’ve got to use it right. The point isn’t to swap out doctors for robots-it’s to give them a boost so they can help us better. So, here’s the big question: Can we make sure AI’s got humanity’s back without messing up on ethics, fairness, or trust? If cool projects like NeuroVision show us how to do AI the responsible way, I’d say we’ve got a solid shot at a “heck yes.” What’s your take where do we set the boundaries?

Understanding the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS The bill seeks to establish clear guidelines for social media operators and users, focusing on ensuring a safe and secure digital environment. Among its key provisions, it outlines the following: Licensing for Digital Platforms: Companies or institutions operating digital platforms will need to obtain a license, valid for two years, to run social media sites in Nepal. Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to the revocation of their operating license. Content Regulations: The Bill targets cyberbullying, identity theft, misinformation, hate speech, deep fake videos, and other harmful digital behaviors. It also aims to control the spread of content that could jeopardize national peace, security, or sovereignty. Fines and Penalties: Users who engage in harmful online activities such as trolling, spreading false information, or engaging in online harassment could face fines of up to Rs 500,000. This would affect students who are active on social media platforms, potentially limiting their ability to express themselves freely. How Will This Affect Nepalese Students? Impact on Freedom of Expression One of the main concerns about the bill is its potential effect on freedom of speech and expression. While the government’s intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online. Education and Learning Many students rely on social media platforms for educational content, online courses, webinars, and knowledge-sharing. However, the new Bill’s stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill. Online Privacy and Data Security One of the Bill’s main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and Accountability With fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bill’s broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the “wrong intention,” means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media Landscape The implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital Environment As Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

{"id": "sunway_116", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/2025/04/page/2/", "title": "No Title", "content": "April 2025 - of 2 - Sunway College Kathmandu Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer Sci-Fi, it’s here, transforming industries, and AI in healthcare is one of the most promising yet complex domains it’s reshaping. From detecting cancer in medical scans to predicting strokes before they occur, AI has the potential to make healthcare faster, more efficient, and more precise. But alongside these advancements come technical hurdles, ethical dilemmas, and critical questions about how much control we should give to algorithms in life-and-death decisions. So, what does the future of AI in healthcare look like? Let’s explore. The Promise of AI in Healthcare AI in medicine is like having a supercharged doctor with a photographic memory and lightning-fast thinking. It’s already changing the game, spotting diseases like Alzheimer’s and breast cancer earlier and more accurately than ever. Hospitals are using AI to cut down ER wait times and manage resources better, while in drug discovery, breakthroughs like DeepMind’s AlphaFold are rewriting the rules of protein research. Imagine taking a pill crafted exclusively for you designed to target your condition with laser precision, minimize side effects, and accelerate recovery. That’s the promise of personalized medicine. At a biomedical hackathon at Kathmandu University, I got a deep dive into human genetics and discovered how genetic sequencing, protein interactions, and biomarker analysis could unlock this future. Of course, challenges like data privacy and algorithmic bias remain, but one thing is clear-AI is revolutionizing healthcare in the best way possible. Key Challenges in Implementation of AI in HealthCare With great power comes great responsibility-and AI in healthcare is the Spider-Man of modern medicine. It’s got all this dazzling potential, but sorry, folks, it’s not as easy as flicking an “on” switch and calling it a day. AI depends on vast amounts of high-quality data, but medical records are often scattered, incomplete, or trapped in outdated systems. When AI feeds on bad data, it produces unreliable predictions, leading to potential misdiagnoses and treatment errors. The challenge isn’t just collecting data but ensuring it is accurate, standardized, and accessible. Then there’s the cost challenge. Developing and implementing AI isn’t inexpensive-it takes a significant investment for hospitals to bring it on board. Smaller clinics and less-funded regions often can’t keep up, watching from the sidelines as larger institutions adopt the technology. This isn’t just unfortunate-it could deepen the gap in healthcare access, where advanced AI tools are mostly available to well-resourced facilities. Patient care shouldn’t feel exclusive, should it? Then there’s the issue of trust. Doctors aren’t always eager to embrace algorithms-they’ve spent years building their expertise through hands-on experience, not managing software. Many view AI with skepticism, unsure of its role in their practice. Without thorough training and clear evidence that AI supports rather than replaces their judgment, adoption will likely remain gradual. AI’s role in healthcare must be that of an assistant, not an authority-augmenting human expertise rather than attempting to replace it. The potential? Oh, it’s huge -AI could be the rockstar of healthcare. But if we don’t tackle these hiccups, it might just end up as another overhyped gadget gathering dust in the corner. Ethical Concerns Beyond technical and financial barriers, AI in healthcare raises serious ethical questions. Let’s ensure this revolution succeeds, time to address the challenges thoughtfully and focus on effective solutions! Privacy and Data Security AI requires access to extensive patient data to function effectively, but this poses risks. Medical records contain highly sensitive information-who controls access, and how can we ensure data remains secure? Patients deserve transparency and strict safeguards against breaches or misuse. Bias and Fairness AI systems learn from old data, and sometimes that data has a few sneaky flaws. If it shortchanges certain groups, the AI might not treat everyone fairly. Case in point: one fancy AI once underestimated Black patients’ needs because it was fed healthcare spending stats that weren’t quite balanced. Fixing these little hiccups is a must to keep AI healthcare fair for all. Accountability and Trust When AI makes a medical error, who is responsible-the doctor, the developer, or the algorithm itself? Unlike human professionals, AI cannot explain its reasoning in a way we always understand, making accountability difficult. Trust in AI requires transparency, rigorous testing, and the ability for healthcare providers to interpret and validate AI recommendations. NeuroVision: A Case Study in Responsible AI Development One project that highlights AI’s potential, when developed responsibly, is NeuroVision. This initiative uses AI to classify brain tumors from DICOM medical images, based on a proposed technical architecture that integrates deep learning models with cloud-based processing for improved speed and accuracy. The dataset for this system is developed using Functional APIs, which enable efficient handling and structuring of complex medical imaging data. If implemented with proper ethical considerations, it could significantly enhance early tumor detection, leading to faster diagnoses and improved treatment planning. However, for NeuroVision to succeed ethically, several factors must be addressed: Data Transparency & Security : Ensuring patient imaging data is handled with the highest standards of encryption and privacy protection. Bias Mitigation : Training the model on diverse datasets to avoid racial, gender, or socioeconomic disparities in diagnosis. Explainability : Implementing explainable AI (XAI) techniques to help radiologists understand why the AI reached a particular conclusion, rather than treating it as a “black box.” Collaboration with Medical Experts : Ensuring that NeuroVision remains a tool that assists radiologists rather than replaces them, maintaining human oversight in critical decisions. If developed with these ethical pillars in mind, NeuroVision could set an example for responsible AI integration in healthcare, proving that innovation and responsibility can go hand in hand. The Road Ahead: Balancing Innovation and Responsibility The future of AI in healthcare all comes down to finding that sweet spot. We need strong rules to make sure AI plays fair, owns up to its mistakes, and keeps our data safe. And let’s be real-transparency matters. If patients and doctors can’t figure out how AI comes up with its answers, they’re not going to trust it, plain and simple. The trick is teamwork. AI techies, doctors, ethicists, and policymakers have to join forces to build systems that aren’t just cutting-edge but also decent and focused on people. Think of it like a three-legged stool: you’ve got innovation, responsibility, and trust holding it up. Kick one out, and the whole thing comes crashing down. The good news? We’re already seeing some wins. A few hospitals are testing out AI that explains itself, governments are sketching out ethics rules, and researchers are digging into the messy stuff like bias and fairness. Still, we’ve got a ways to go-nobody said this would be a quick fix! Conclusion AI could shake up healthcare-think of quicker diagnoses, sharper treatments, and healthier vibes all around. But let’s not kid ourselves: tech isn’t some magic fix-it wand. It’s more like a trusty tool, and we’ve got to use it right. The point isn’t to swap out doctors for robots-it’s to give them a boost so they can help us better. So, here’s the big question: Can we make sure AI’s got humanity’s back without messing up on ethics, fairness, or trust? If cool projects like NeuroVision show us how to do AI the responsible way, I’d say we’ve got a solid shot at a “heck yes.” What’s your take where do we set the boundaries?

{"id": "sunway_117", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/", "title": "No Title", "content": "admin, Author at Sunway College Kathmandu AI is changing the world, from personalizing education to speeding up legal proceedings. Nepal is starting to have some serious conversations about how to bring AI into both classrooms and courtrooms. Sounds great, right? Smarter learning, fewer court delays, and even fewer “lost” files at government offices. But before we start imagining an AI-powered utopia, let’s take a step back and ask: Are we actually ready for this? AI in Education : Smarter Learning or Just Smarter Cheating? There’s no doubt that AI could make education better-adaptive learning, instant feedback, automated grading. No more teachers drowning in piles of homework, no more students struggling to keep up in one-size-fits-all lessons. Sounds perfect. Except... we all know what’s actually going to happen. The minute AI becomes a classroom staple, half the students will be using it to actually learn , while the other half will figure out how to get ChatGPT to do their homework while they scroll TikTok. Teachers, instead of grading essays, will be busy trying to figure out if a real student wrote that beautifully worded analysis on Shakespeare-or if it was just AI flexing its literary muscles. At a recent consultation on AI in education, officials, tech experts, and educators sat down to discuss what this all means for Nepal. Baikuntha Prasad Aryal from the Ministry of Education pointed out that we need to integrate AI into schools now if we don’t want to fall behind. But it’s not as simple as flipping a switch. Nepal has to make sure AI is being used to bridge gaps , not widen them. Because if we’re not careful, we’ll end up in a situation where fancy private schools have AI-powered tutors while public schools are still struggling with basic internet access. Michael Croft from UNESCO put it best-if we don’t have a clear plan, we’ll be left with chaos. And honestly, Nepal has enough of that already. AI in the Courts: A Fix for Legal Backlogs or a Future of Robot Judges? Over in the legal world, AI is being pitched as the ultimate analytical person. Nepal’s court system has been drowning in backlogged cases for years , so AI could be a game changer. Imagine an AI-powered system organizing case files, scheduling hearings, and sorting through mountains of paperwork in seconds. The dream! But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. While AI is great at analyzing data, the law isn’t about data. It’s about human judgment, cultural context, and sometimes, the ability of a judge to stare at a witness until they crack under the pressure. Can AI do that? Probably not. And then there’s the issue of bias. AI is only as good as the data it learns from. If we feed it outdated, biased legal precedents, it’s just going to spit out decisions that reinforce the same old problems. Also, let’s not forget-Nepal’s legal system deals with some wild cases. Imagine an AI judge trying to settle a property dispute over a sacred cow . Would it suggest a fair legal rule, or would it just start Googling “cow ownership laws” and crash from confusion? Data security is another big concern. Nepal’s courts handle a lot of sensitive information. If AI systems aren’t built with proper safeguards, we could be looking at some serious privacy issues. The last thing we need is a legal database getting hacked and people’s private case details ending up who-knows-where . So, What’s the Plan? AI isn’t here to replace teachers or judges here to assist them. In schools, AI should make learning more engaging and personalized, not turn students into expert-level AI users who never actually study . In courts, AI should help speed up the system, not take over decision-making. Because the last thing Nepal needs is a court ruling delayed because the AI judge needed a software update . If we do this right, AI could genuinely make Nepal’s education and legal systems faster, smarter, and fairer . But if we rush in without a plan, we could be looking at a future where students don’t actually learn, and AI judges accidentally hand out life sentences for traffic violations . The future is exciting-but only if we don’t let AI run wild. Inspired by: UNESCO’s consultation on AI in Nepal’s education system and how it could change learning experiences. Discussions from the Kathmandu Post on AI’s potential role in the judiciary while keeping human judgment at the center. The very real possibility of students using AI to “study” without actually learning anything. The even bigger possibility of AI judges completely misinterpreting Nepal’s very complex legal system. For thousands of years, humans have looked up at the night sky, searching for meaning, guidance, and understanding. Astronomy, the study of celestial objects and the universe , has played a crucial role in shaping human civilization. From ancient navigation to modern scientific breakthroughs, astronomy has expanded our knowledge and transformed our daily lives in profound ways. Yet, while the vastness of the universe might make us feel insignificant, it is through our relentless pursuit of knowledge that we find purpose in discovery and progress.

Tabled by the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, the Bill aims to regulate the growing use of social media platforms, holding users and operators accountable for their actions. While the government cites its goal of promoting social goodwill, cultural tolerance, and good governance, there are growing concerns about how this Bill will impact students, particularly in terms of their freedom of expression and online engagement. Understanding the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS The bill seeks to establish clear guidelines for social media operators and users, focusing on ensuring a safe and secure digital environment. Among its key provisions, it outlines the following: Licensing for Digital Platforms: Companies or institutions operating digital platforms will need to obtain a license, valid for two years, to run social media sites in Nepal. Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to the revocation of their operating license. Content Regulations: The Bill targets cyberbullying, identity theft, misinformation, hate speech, deep fake videos, and other harmful digital behaviors. It also aims to control the spread of content that could jeopardize national peace, security, or sovereignty. Fines and Penalties: Users who engage in harmful online activities such as trolling, spreading false information, or engaging in online harassment could face fines of up to Rs 500,000. This would affect students who are active on social media platforms, potentially limiting their ability to express themselves freely. How Will This Affect Nepalese Students? Impact on Freedom of Expression One of the main concerns about the bill is its potential effect on freedom of speech and expression. While the government’s intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online. Education and Learning Many students rely on social media platforms for educational content, online courses, webinars, and knowledge-sharing. However, the new Bill’s stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill. Online Privacy and Data Security One of the Bill’s main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and Accountability With fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bill’s broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the “wrong intention,” means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media Landscape The implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital Environment As Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

Threads allow you to see a feed of everything that’s going on with your friends or persons you’re interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? They’ve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before they’re able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because it’s linked to your Instagram account, you won’t have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads’ unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new People’s Choice hero. They’ve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside. Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment. What makes Twitter differ from Threads? Threads vs Twitter Twitter’s unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives. The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union. Automatic Status Sharing The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations. Threads intelligently recognize and share information about a user’s current status, such as location, movement, or even the music they are listening to, using powerful AI algorithms . While these capabilities may raise privacy concerns for some users, the app assures that users control information sharing, emphasizing transparency and consent. Conclusion Threads intended to debut in a minimal, stable state for V1, resembling Twitter with deliberate Instagram design aspects. Moreover, it is appropriately called since users have begun to refer to Threads as strings of messages, and it’s straightforward, with your newsfeed consisting of individuals you follow and those you don’t. It nails the basics-visually appealing, runs smoothly, almost bug-free-making it a less overwhelming alternative to Twitter.

Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research. One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha (and team) have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at (March 2021 Intake). Let’s have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor ? The rise of IoT (Internet of Things) is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system ‘ IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor ’ is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. There’s usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 (Temperature-Humidity Sensor) Bread Board DS18B20 (Water Temperature Sensor) Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil & Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, let’s understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the project’s outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result & Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ide’s serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometer’s serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of . I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway College’s research lab and beyond that. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The panipuri’s flavored water is dispensed using this technique. The system uses electronic components such as an Arduino , a breadboard , a jumper, a relay, and an adjustable IR sensor. The system works on the straightforward premise of detecting an item beneath the sensor and signaling the relay to activate the switch. Devices used Keywords: Arduino, IoT, Relay, Adjustable IR Sensor Benefits of automatic water dispenser Not just for panipuri, this device is usable in many fields. Below are a few benefits of having an automatic water dispenser: Portable Less amount of human effort Fetch the flavored water automatically Less use of the hand. Conventional Increase sales Working Process of the Automatic Panipuri Water Dispenser The device follows 5 different steps to dispense flavored water. Let’s break it down and understand. Turn on the device Sense Objects Arduino receives data from the sensor Transmits signals to the relay to turn on the dispenser Fetch flavored water. Methodology of developing an automatic water dispenser The methodology consists of the following steps for making this project real: Research and survey: Research is crucial to any project. Before starting this project, first and foremost we researched past works, designs, and projects. Other, comparable devices, such as automatic sanitizers, have been the subject of research. System Design: In system design, we design the device considering its architecture, shape, and size. Also, We also list out the components for the system and plan the system operation and hardware requirements for the project. Additionally, we designed a 3D print. Software Implementation In the software implementation process, we create Arduino code in the Arduino IDE according to the design and upload the code to Arduino for prototyping and testing. Prototyping & Testing In, Prototyping and testing phase, we test the working of the device with a small developed prototype. Device and component integration: After the prototype, we integrate all devices and components per design and code. The materials such as Arduino, an Adjustable IR Sensor, jumper wires, wires, a USB charger, pipe, wiring strips, 12 v chargers, stalls, etc. Data collection & Analysis In this stage, we gather data and analyze it as necessary. From our analysis, we found, that the object should be 5-6 cm away to sense by the system. And, It takes 3 seconds to get the flavor-infused water from the bucket once the thing is discovered. Result In the result phase, we gather the outcome. As a consequence, we validate if the system operates as intended. Although the dispenser has to be cleaned every day while it is in use. But the good thing is, This project is working and put into action effectively. Conclusion The Automated Panipuri water dispenser is a gadget that senses the Puri and automatically fetches the flavor-infused water. This method can be handy in restaurants, cafes, hotels, etc. Moreover, the gadget has several benefits as we discussed, and is frequently used for automated dispensing in Nepal and other nations too.

{"id": "sunway_127", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter/", "title": "No Title", "content": "Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter? I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and I’m excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, it’s not that straightforward. 🍿 Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, it’s essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Here’s what I discovered: 📉 Decline in Length: Genres like Children’s and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content. 📈 Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friend’s data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization , boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021 . Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If we’re going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas . But first we’ll need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Let’s start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python : a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. We’ll also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Let’s perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friend’s assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friend’s aggregations, we’re limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path \"datasets/netflix_data.csv\" . Let’s create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friend’s data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type . Scanning the column, it’s clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show (perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons)? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie . While we’re at it, we don’t need information from all of the columns, so let’s create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title , country , genre , release_year , and duration . Let’s put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. We’ve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Let’s try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so let’s try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much rmative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Let’s filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as “Children”, “Stand-Up”, and “Documentaries”. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For rmation, you can refer to the documentation here ! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, we’ll also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use() . The latter isn’t taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find rmation on customizing the style of your plot here ! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as children’s movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we can’t know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, you’ve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas . This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas . We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

{"id": "sunway_132", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms/", "title": "No Title", "content": "6 Data Science Terms Everybody Must Know in 2023 What happens to all this data? Where does it go? What do we use it for? And, What do most popular data science terms resemble? Data science is the answer to all these questions. Data science is the field of science that applies algorithms, methods, and processes to extract information from random and non-random data . Simply put, it is the process of finding patterns among the noise and using it to predict and solve various problems across a wide range of applications. I will come back to 6 data science terms that everybody must know in 2023, very shortly. It harvests the power of statistics, data analysis, and modeling, along with the use of data structures, algorithms, and machine learning to interpret the findings from massive hordes of data. From Spotify’s recommendation algorithms to predicting human behavior, data science has a wide variety of applications in today’s fast-paced world. At Sunway College, we primarily focus on bringing the change that is required in the current digital space. The current generation is the Internet generation. According to a report by Statista , in 2021 alone, humanity created 74 zettabytes of data. That’s 74000000000 terabytes of data , in ONE year. That’s up from 59 zettabytes in 2020, and just below the projected 94 zettabytes of data in 2022. Most Popular Terms in Data Science To understand data science, here are a few of the basic keywords and terms that you need to know about today. Algorithms: In computer science, we can define an algorithm as a specific set of processes used to solve a problem or perform computation. Algorithms are hardware and software-specific instruction lists that complete the given process in hand. For example, the simplest of algorithms perform tasks like sorting a set of numbers in descending order, while the most complex set of algorithms guide and work on a natural language processing system. In the field of data science, professionals widely employ algorithms. Given the focus on big data, data scientists need precise algorithms to reduce processing times and operational costs significantly. Some of the common algorithms used in the field of data science include Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting algorithms, etc. Data Mining: We can define data mining as the process of converting raw data into useful information. Data mining involves looking into large sets of data in a database, analyzing patterns and behaviors of the data entities, and using the result to create better algorithms, strategies , and plans for the business. Data science, as the name suggests, heavily operates on data. Therefore, it means it requires a large amount of data to work with. It involves various data mining and warehousing techniques on the data with classification, clustering, and predictive analysis of the given data. Large companies use data mining to create better algorithms, understand customer behavior, and create AI and ML-powered hardware and software. Big Data Big Data can be defined as data, that is BIG (literally!) . It defines large volumes of data that can be structured or unstructured , mined from various sources in a large quantity. Five Vs define big data: Variety, Volume, Velocity, Value, and Veracity. Big Data is sourced from large, complex sources. Big Data poses a unique challenge addressed by data science. It is a massive capital for businesses and companies that can analyze this data to understand customer behavior, insightful analysis of products and services offered, and predict their purchase and usage behavior. Data science uses various algorithms and processes to derive insights from big data. Deep Learning In computer science, we can define deep learning as the process of machine learning that uses structures similar to human brains (called neural networks). Deep learning is used to make better algorithms, data sets, and AI hardware and software. Deep learning uses powerful computers and large sets of data with output (called supervised learning ) and without output (called unsupervised learning ) to understand and predict patterns and outcomes. In Data Science, we employ the use of neural networks and methodologies to study big data with massive models on a large level computational scale. Usually, we utilize deep learning to create better algorithms, and insights on specifics such as user experience of a product, facial recognition, behavior pattern processing, etc. Data science combines the power of deep learning, data, and computer science to generate new insights and value for businesses. Web Scraping Web scraping is the web data extraction process used to extract data from websites . Automated technology retrieves bulk unstructured data, typically HTML, from numerous websites in the process known as web scraping. A database methodically stores structured data, facilitating its utilization for analysis, training, and research purposes. Data scientists use various existing frameworks such as Scrapy, a Python-based web crawler. Data scientists prefer Beautiful Soup, a tool akin to extracting and storing large website data in databases. Therefore, we use web scraping for price monitoring across e-commerce platforms and email marketing. Similarly, emotion analysis across social media platforms and news monitoring purposes are also done using web scraping. Moreover, this data can also be fed to machine learning algorithms for training and prediction purposes. Natural Language Processing (NLP): One of the most frequent data science terms. Natural Language Processing is a subfield of deep learning that is concerned with Human Linguistics . It is the process of identifying and understanding meaningful phrases from a human language and generating meaningful phrases and sentences that look like a natural form . NLP includes two sub-sections, Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Natural Language Processing involves five phases. Lexical (structure) analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, discourse integration, and pragmatic analysis . Some of the well-known areas of NLP are Speech recognition (Siri, Google Assistant), Chatbots(Maya chat, ), and Optical Character recognition (Google Lens,). Conclusion We can understand the importance of data science in today’s technology-infused world. Understanding data science terms broadens domains, aiding students and enthusiasts in getting serious about this field. We have introduced two new courses in a digital space.

{"id": "sunway_134", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/generative-ai-pioneering-the-future/", "title": "No Title", "content": "Generative AI: Pioneering the Future! Generative AI revolutionizes the creative process by allowing humans to supervise while machines generate. This shift relieves us from tedious, risky, and challenging tasks. Similarly, it also enables us to concentrate on the core aspects of our work: vision, ideas, and purpose. It represents a transformative change in the future of employment. Importance of Generative AI Generative AI, like photography and celluloid film, represents an incredible creative revolution. It reduces the necessity for creative skill in painting or singing, just as photography emancipated us from relying entirely on artists to depict the truth. The influence of Generative AI goes beyond creativity. It gives rapid access to clear information and the automatic development of varied material. Material such as news stories, product descriptions, bespoke designs, music, visual effects, and more. It is redefining specialized professions. Additionally, it is also redefining our view of work. AI models increasingly aid with repetitive or computational activities in the manufacturing process. How is Generative AI different from other AI? In contrast to other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI focuses on producing new material, whereas discriminative AI classifies existing data. Generative AI is used for picture production, video synthesis , language generation, and music composition. It is one of the subcategories of artificial intelligence. It encompasses various activities done by AI systems. Reactive machines for self-driving cars, limited memory AI for weather forecasting, theory of mind for virtual customer assistance, narrow AI for personalized product suggestions in e-commerce, supervised learning for object identification, unsupervised learning for fraud detection in banking, and reinforcement learning for teaching machines to play games are all examples of these tasks. Generative AI encompasses several of these areas and continues to grow, with its primary goal being the production of new material, whether writing, graphics, or product suggestions. How does Generative AI work? To recognize patterns and produce new results, generative AI employs techniques such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms. It learns the basic principles guiding the content by studying a vast dataset. It generates fresh data by sampling from a previously learned distribution. The model refines the output to fit the desired outcome through a process known as “inference,” making it more realistic and aligned with user preferences. Generative AI Models 1. Natural Language Model Natural Language Model is the most well-known model of Generative AI, with ChatGPT making headlines. The majority of the excitement around text-based Generative AI is centered on a model known as GPT-3. It’s a language model created by OpenAI, a research group dedicated to the development and promotion of friendly AI. For example, while computers cannot “understand” language in the same way that humans can, natural language technologies are becoming more effective at identifying the context and meaning of phrases and words and converting them into suitable responses-and actions. 2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a well-known form of Generative AI. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator that work together to enhance the generator’s ability to generate realistic data. Over time, the generator improves its capacity to synthesize lifelike data, resulting in the creation of new items, assets, faces, and even people. GANs can be utilized for various applications, including generating natural features such as lightning, leaves, roots, eyes, and flowers, as well as seamlessly integrating humans with nature. Furthermore, in the context of financial fraud detection, GAN models can generate synthetic fraudulent transactions to train fraud detection algorithms. 3. VAE and Anomaly Detection Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are a major model used for anomaly identification. It entails training the model on a collection of normal data and then utilizing it to detect occurrences that deviate from the norm. VAE has applications in a variety of fields, including financial fraud detection, discovering defects in manufacturing processes, and detecting network breaches. For example, Google has used VAE to identify network attacks. Future Prediction Generative AI will continue to play a critical role in computer graphics, animation, and 3D modeling in the gaming, film, and marketing industries. It will also be employed in the next decade or so to improve virtual assistants’ and chatbots’ natural language understanding, allowing them to conduct complicated discussions. In the future, generative AI will help to create realistic simulations in sectors like architecture and engineering, create new materials and products in manufacturing and textile design, and aid in natural language production for news articles, novels, and movie screenplays. Conclusion In terms of utility and predictability, generative AI is similar to a camera, acting as a powerful instrument in the hands of people. Just like a camera performs reliably, generative AI follows the same pattern each time it is used. It enables people to use their skills to generate content, develop new solutions, and explore creative possibilities. Users may leverage the potential of generative AI to improve productivity, accelerate improvements, and stimulate discoveries by understanding and utilizing its consistent nature.

{"id": "sunway_136", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter/", "title": "No Title", "content": "Threads Vs Twitter: Communication Clash! | Sunway College Threads is a social networking software developed by Meta, which created Instagram and Facebook. Threads allow you to see a feed of everything that’s going on with your friends or persons you’re interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? They’ve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before they’re able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because it’s linked to your Instagram account, you won’t have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads’ unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new People’s Choice hero. They’ve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside. Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment. What makes Twitter differ from Threads? Threads vs Twitter Twitter’s unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives. The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union. Automatic Status Sharing The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations. Threads intelligently recognize and share information about a user’s current status, such as location, movement, or even the music they are listening to, using powerful AI algorithms . While these capabilities may raise privacy concerns for some users, the app assures that users control information sharing, emphasizing transparency and consent. Conclusion Threads intended to debut in a minimal, stable state for V1, resembling Twitter with deliberate Instagram design aspects. Moreover, it is appropriately called since users have begun to refer to Threads as strings of messages, and it’s straightforward, with your newsfeed consisting of individuals you follow and those you don’t. It nails the basics-visually appealing, runs smoothly, almost bug-free-making it a less overwhelming alternative to Twitter.

{"id": "sunway_142", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/category/blog/reasons-developers-choose-rust/page/2/", "title": "No Title", "content": "The Rise of Rust: Why Developers Love It As we are getting more technology exposure here in Nepal, a lot of new methods and changes have been seen in multiple. But not quite much in the banking sector. As smartphones are now available almost all over the country, it is no surprise that Artificial Intelligence is also starting to pop here. However, like technology, Nepal’s banking sector has been slower compared to other sectors. Banks in Nepal, while modernizing and adopting new techniques, are still hesitant to fully accept AI. This is mainly due to the terms of infrastructure regulation, and trust. But as Nepal’s financial services sector continues to evolve, AI offers multiple services: personalized services and many more. It also offers smarter risk management and more secure transaction processes. So let’s see and explore why the banking sector is slow in this trend. Similarly, let’s explore what opportunity this technology holds, and how we can benefit from this system. The Challenge of AI Adoption in Nepal’s Banking Sector Regulatory and Compliance Concerns Nepal’s banking system operates under a strict regulatory framework. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank of Nepal, closely monitors financial institutions. Additionally, it ensures the safety and security of customer deposits and financial systems. While there are regulations regarding AI being adopted globally at a slow pace, Nepal’s banking sector is particularly cautious. This is due to the lack of clear guidelines on how to implement AI technologies within the confines of its regulatory environment. For instance, the NRB’s existing regulation, which focuses mainly on traditional banking methods, might not fully be compatible with the data-driven nature of AI. With AI systems relying heavily on data, including sensitive customer information, its compliance with NEpal’s privacy act and others becomes even more complex. Therefore there is a rooted hesitation in implementing AI solutions as the main concern is data security and regulatory oversight. 1. Data Security and Privacy As said, Data Security remains a concerning topic and a top priority for Banks. As AI requires large datasets to function effectively, the risk of security breaches and data misuse is a growing concern. It is also to be noted that Nepal’s Banking system is often targeted by cybercriminals and this kind of news on people’s data being breached or leaked is common. To reduce this an AI should have a secure system to mitigate threats like fraud, hacking, and identity theft. In Nepal where the digital payment system is just a new innovative step compared to other countries who have already introduced this system years ago and yet still begot one or two problems in the well-established payment system we use today. Now, introducing AI to this field and trusting that AI’s ability to keep personal and financial data is very hard. To do this we will require time and a lot of data to train the model. Additionally meeting the demand of both customers and regulators in the process is also important. 2. Infrastructure and Legacy Systems Many banks in Nepal still operate on legacy traditional systems. The systems are not designed to integrate with the advanced features of AI. Unlike other countries where banks have new cutting-edge technology, Nepali financial institutions often operate on older core banking systems. The cost and risk of upgrading this system can be problematic, especially for smaller or regional banks. Additionally, the high quantity data for training ML models, is a hectic process here as majority of data collection , storage and sharing are oftenfragmented which creates another roadblock for Ai-driven solution. As a result, banks are very serious and cautious in the approach of Ai integration and monthly reluctant to overhaul the existing system that they are comfortable with. 3. Skill Gap AI itself is a new concept introduced in Nepal. The skills required to develop and manage AI are thus limited here. While there has been growth in the tech industry, the specialized knowledge needed to operate AI-driven tools. But in the banking sector or any other sector, such tools are quite limited. Data Scientists, machine learning engineers, and Ai specialists are in high demand globally, and Nepal’s banking sector faces the same shortage of talents. The Opportunities of AI in Nepal’s Banking Sector Despite these challenges, the potential for Ai in Nepal’s banking sector is huge, and here is how Ai can make a difference: 1. Personalized Banking Services The Nepalese banking sector focuses on customer service enhancement as mobile banking services expand their reach to residents of urban and rural Nepal. The implementation of AI enables Nepali banks to deliver customized products that specifically address the personal requirements of their individual customers. AI-powered chatbots provide round-the-clock customer support facilities that handle inquiries and transactions alongside personalized financial recommendations based on user spending behavior. The increase in Nepali consumers choosing mobile and digital banking platforms will drive escalated requirements for personalized banking services across the industry. AI systems examine financial records in combination with payment behaviors and societal indicators to customize financial services that let users improve their money management strategies. 2. Fraud Detection and Prevention The growth of digital banking across Nepal has produced intensified banking fraud cases affecting the industry. Artificial intelligence functions as a reliable instrument to both find and halt fraudulent behavior. AI leverages real-time transaction analysis through machine learning algorithms to spot unexpected spending activities which then allows it to notify bank customers or the institution before major financial losses occur. AI technology assists Nepali banks to discover credit card abuse together with money laundering and identity theft leading to enhanced cybersecurity protection. The implementation of AI would deliver necessary security measures when Nepali banks plan to expand their digital services. 3. Operational Efficiency Bank institutions throughout Nepal together with international financial institutions seek continuous methods to minimize operational costs and enhance operational efficiency. The implementation of AI solutions enables banks to execute repetitive duties like data recording together with loan analysis while running credit ratings besides checking against industry regulations. The implementation of AI leads banks to achieve better operational efficiency with reduced costs. The Nepalese banking system which maintains mostly manual and paper-intensive services can experience rapid progress thanks to AI applications. Benefits from this approach would improve the customer journey while simultaneously lowering both operational expenses and human-related service shortcomings. Conclusion The banking sector in Nepal is approaching an era of artificial intelligence transformation. The banking sector of Nepal faces ongoing challenges linked to regulatory checkpoints and limited infrastructure. In addition to the shortage of capable personnel but the promise of AI to enhance customer service and operations exists in direct proportion to its capacity to boost security measures. Future improvements in Nepal’s digital environment will make artificial intelligence essential for banking organizations. It will make us want to stay competitive while serving customers who use technology. The banking sector in Nepal will adapt AI capabilities at a moderate pace given that future prospects appear positive. If Nepal’s financial institutions establish plans, gain regulatory certainty and prioritize data security then they can use AI to develop an efficient banking system that is centered on customer needs and secured operations. Introduction Optical character recognition is the key to document process automation in today’s digital world, as it allows machines to read printed and handwritten texts. Although OCR has made significant progress in some major languages such as English, Chinese, and Spanish, it remains a great challenge to low-resource languages, which do not have a digital dataset of their own and NLP resources. This article will discover how recent AI and deep learning advancements are revolutionizing low-resource language OCR for low-resource languages. Its implementation in low-resource languages has remained only a dream until the recent advancement and breakthrough in AI and deep learning. This is going to bring a new possibility for OCR with low-resource languages, which may revolutionize the sectors of government documentation, historical text digitization, and financial automation in regions of these languages, and hence large-prevailing areas, among others. He then proceeds to explain the challenges of OCR in low-resource languages, elaborating on the very recent advancement in AI-driven OCR and how it is impacting automation across different industries. Understanding Low-Resource Languages in OCR What Are Low-Resource Languages? Low-resourced languages are those languages that normally lack large-scale annotated data, clean and robust linguistic resources (such as dictionaries and corpora), labeled training data, and, more than anything, powerful and well-supported research in computational linguistics. Some of the most famous examples are Nepali, Sinhala, and Amharic; in general, local, indigenous languages that do not have large communities developed around them. While languages such as English or Chinese have billions of texts available in digital form, such languages often suffer from a lack of labeled text data to train an OCR system. OCR and Its Role in Automation OCR is the technology to convert the hard-copy or scanned text into a machine-readable format. It’s applied in wide areas such as: Document digitization (scanning books, archives, historical records) Automated processing of invoices and receipts (financial automation) Automatic data entry in government and enterprise workflows Assistive support technologies like reading tools for the visually impaired OCR systems include Google Tesseract for high-resource languages, ABBYY FineReader, Amazon Textract, and several others. OCR systems like Google Tesseract work very well for high-resource languages. Still, for low-resource languages, the efficiency of the tools described above depends primarily on the data available and is therefore often associated with low accuracy because there is a scarcity of this data, combined with complex scripts and various handwriting styles. Challenges in OCR for Low-Resource Languages Lack of High-Quality Training Data OCR models inherently require thousands to millions of labeled text image pairs for effective training. In most low-resource languages, there is already a lack of digitized books, newspapers, etc., which further hampers training a good OCR model. Texts from books and newspapers available in low-resource languages are mostly turn of the century with highly deteriorated quality. It is, therefore, a big problem for the straightening and orderly OCR training model. Complex and Unique Scripts Written low-resource languages are generally non-Latin scripts, which pose a big challenge to any OCR engine. This might be associated with: Devanagari script (used in Nepali, Hindi, and Marathi) with character formations that are very tough Ethiopic script found in Amharic, which has many unique glyphs Also, Brahmic scripts are associated with ligatures and stacked letters. The traditional OCR models fail to yield good results on these scripts, especially when it comes to recognizing handwritten text. Poorly Scanned, Noisy Data Most of the documents written in low-resource languages have been scanned from deteriorated, old, and dirty sources and could have ink smudges, faded text, torn pages, or mixed text of different languages within the same document. Some of them may not have uniform font or space, which will make the OCR system much less accurate compared to those in high-resource languages. Lack of NLP Support for Post-Processing OCR is sometimes dependent on the NLP models, which help in better output correction for spell and grammar checking, etc. Since low-resourced languages suffer from the problem of missing pre-trained NLP models, OCR systems often fail to correct errors in the extracted text effectively. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning: The New Wave in OCR Automation The use of deep learning research in OCR models supported by artificial intelligence has been engaged in automating text extraction in under-resourced languages. This is one of the main methods they achieve this. Self-Supervised and Few-Shot Learning Instead of having to depend on huge labeled datasets, the AI models are now learning by being: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-The models learn from unlabelled data in large corpora at the input level like raw text or images. Few-Shot Learning-is to learn patterns based on very small data points, of course, instrumental for rare languages, an example of it being Facebook’s SeamlessM4T model using self-supervised learning to enhance multilingual text recognition - even in languages with less data. Advanced techniques - Transformer-Based OCR Models In the earlier days, OCRs used to be either rule-based or statistical. The modern OCR engines now have transformer models like Tesseract 5.0, TrOCR (pre-trains on high-resource languages and fine-tunes for low-resource languages) from Microsoft, and PaddleOCR (allows users to train custom models for rare scripts). Data Augmentation Techniques Some data augmentation strategies applied by the researchers due to limited labeled datasets include: GANs for generating synthetic data of text images in low-resource languages Rotating, distorting, or blurring text images in the training data to enhance the robustness of OCR. Example: Working on the Sanskrit OCR Project at Google involved extensive work to fix character recognition in ancient manuscripts, for which synthetic text generation had to be used. Cloud OCR Approaches and Edge OCR Enterprises are implementing OCR engines with cloud and mobile edge-computing solutions to enable more universally accessible OCR. Cloud-based OCR services-Google Vision API, and Microsoft Azure OCR-have added support for more low-resource languages. Edge computing enables OCR models on low-power devices, such as smartphones, to automate at scale Ways to Automate OCR in Low-Resource Languages Since AI-OCR is getting strengthened, there are a few significant ways in which OCR can drive automation: In the Federal and Public Administration: Decision-making statement automation for the process of paper-based documents for office work Birth certificates, records of land, and legal forms got scanned to keep in digital format Facilitated automatic document verification to assess citizens in remote areas. In Finance and Banking OCR can process invoices in cheques and in any local language. Digitization of receipts and tax documents for small businesses Preservation of Historical and Cultural OCR proves helpful for scanning old manuscripts and digitizing them; therefore, they can be preserved. OCR helps preserve old texts and manuscripts by conversion to a digital format, thus preserving endangered languages and cultures. AI Assistants and Chatbots OCR can extract the content of documents to power assistant-driven AI. Translate handwritten content into any language The Future of OCR in Low-Resource Languages It has been noted that AI and deep learning have opened up new possibilities for OCR in low-resource languages where automation was not so easy. While the challenges stay-limited datasets, script complexity, and noisy input-new techniques are coming up to improve the accuracy of the procedure. As OCR for low-resource languages gets more reliable, this will allow for the automation of government services, financial processing, cultural preservation, and educational fields. It is this technology that is going to bridge the digital gap by relaying all languages, no matter how rare they are, into beneficiaries of the power of AI-driven automation. This technology is going to be the start of a brand new future where all languages, no matter how rare, are going to benefit from the power of AI-driven automation. The future of OCR is not only with reading text but with digitalizing every language. At the moment cyber-attacks along with data breaches are growing more and more sophisticated by the day. The search for new ways of protecting our very own personal data has never been more critical. Cue biometric authentication new technology is a game-changer in the cyber security field. Spanning from fingerprinting to face scanning and iris scanning, biometric security solutions present a more secure and more convenient alternative. It is replacing and working as an alternative of passwords and PINs. However, as with any emerging tech, the use of biometrics raises serious privacy issues. Additionally, it also raised ethical questions regarding the overall use of biometrics. The Era of Biometric Security (Biometric Authentication) Biometrics is the act of recording our unique physical characteristics. Additionally, it might be a fingerprint, the contours of our face. It also may be the hue of the iris, for instance, we can use it as a form of identification. It is pilfered or lost. Biometrics is an authentication that physically ties to the biology of a human person. Biometric authentication is hard to duplicate. Facial recognition has been so popular because it is easy to use and easy to implement on daily devices. Phones, laptops, and even residential security systems use facial recognition to provide access. Today, it is also an easy and convenient method for consumers to unlock devices. Similarly, fingerprint readers, now ubiquitous on smartphones, are integrated into larger platforms. This will offer a secure and convenient method of verification. Similarly, for even more forward thinkers, there is iris scan technology. The technology provides yet another layer of security, imaging the patterns unique to the eye’s iris to verify identities. These technologies are widely viewed as a possible answer to the long-standing issue of password management. As cyber-attacks become more advanced password files get compromised daily. This leads users to find it difficult to practice good security hygiene. With biometrics, users should not remember complex combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols-they only need to be themselves. The Promise of Biometrics for Online Security The biggest advantage of biometric authentication is being able to create an even higher level of security. Passwords are either weak, used on more than one website, or just plain guessed easily. People use simple phrases or information easily found on the web. Biometrics are much more difficult to replicate. Even if the hacker manages to get your password or PIN, they would require your unique biological characteristics to breach the system. Furthermore, biometric systems are fast and convenient. Opening one’s phone with a quick scan of the individual’s fingerprint or glancing at one’s phone for facial scanning is normal. This kind of convenience can come with the ability to remove a significant amount of friction from users, allowing them to safely log in to online services without having to recall passwords or undergo multiple-step authentication processes. Furthermore, biometric systems can be multi-factor in nature. For instance, a device can require both a fingerprint and a face scan, which adds a layer of protection that isn’t possible with passwords. Since online threats are not demonstrating any indication of decelerating, layered security in the form of biometrics could prove to be one of the most robust protections on hand to combat cybercrime. Privacy Concerns: The Dark Side of Biometric Data For all their potential benefits, biometric systems aren’t without some very legitimate concerns of all of which are those having to do with privacy. Biometric authentication captures and stores a person’s own biological data by its very nature. Unlike a password, which we can change if someone compromises it, we cannot change our fingerprint, face, or iris. Because they are fixed and permanent. If hackers steal or someone mismanages that data, the consequences can be much worse One of the greatest risks is centralized biometric storage. When we login with biometrics, the information is kept on a server or in the cloud. When these databases are compromised by the attackers, they will not just obtain usernames and passwords but also very personal and irreversible data. Unwanted access to this kind of sensitive data could lead to identity theft, fraud, or blackmail. Another concern is the use of surveillance. Facial recognition software has been specifically aimed at application in public areas where people are unaware of being photographed. Governments and non-governmental agencies are using the systems to monitor individuals’ movements, activities, and even political affiliations. Though proponents have argued that it can be used in ways that might make us safer (e.g., to arrest criminals or deter terrorist attacks), others view it as an insidious threat to privacy and a tool for totalitarian oppression. In addition, their accuracy is an issue as well. They can have false positives and false negatives, thus giving unauthorized individuals access or not giving authorized individuals access. The study has determined that facial recognition software, for instance, has been found to operate at a higher rate of errors in identifying females and minorities, bringing about issues regarding the fairness and reliability of these technologies. Balancing Security and Privacy As with any technology progress, the issue with turning biometric authentication into a success is achieving the correct balance between security and privacy. To prevent such systems from being an evil empire, there must be strict regulation and protection mechanisms. Biometric information is encrypted and protected, and people should be in a position to delete or revoke access to their information at their discretion. Transparency about collection and usage of the biometric information will be most important to win consumers’ trust. The second important step is to design biometric systems that are equitable. The developers need to remove biases in facial recognition and other biometric systems so that they function as equally effectively with all populations of people. This will prevent discrimination. similarly, it also makes the population discriminatorily untargeted or excluded by the system. Last, users must be cognizant and careful of the technologies used. With any authentication method, it is intelligent to be knowledgeable of the risks and take measures to protect personal data. Whether activating multi-factor authentication, using encrypted apps, or selecting services with better privacy settings, users have to do something when it pertains to their cyber security. Conclusion: The Future of Biometric Authentication Biometric authentication is quite possibly the key to the cyber security revolution, with newer, quicker, safer methods of access to our data. Going forward, as technology will undoubtedly continue to improve, even new methods of authentication will emerge, such as voice or even DNA scanning. With all of the innovation, however, we need to be careful not to miss the privacy risk. Finally, the future of biometric security will be in our own hands, as we decide to balance the delicate trade-off between convenience, security, and privacy. With regulatory control, ethical innovation, and transparency as a priority, biometric authentication could well be the answer to a safer online existence. But with every innovation, we must move cautiously lest we mortgage privacy on the altar of convenience in a way we would later regret. Over the past ten years, Rust grew from an experimental project to one of the globe’s best-loved programming languages. Stack Overflow polls have demonstrated its popularity among programmers every year. It has consistently ranked as the ‘most loved’ language for several consecutive years. But are programmers truly so in love with this language? Why do engineers-from amateurs to industrial-scale professionals-keep choosing this language? Especially when so many others are competing in the same space?Today’s blog will delve into what makes this language so popular, its standout features, and how it has been able to etch itself a distinctive niche in contemporary software development. A Brief History Rust was a side project from Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare in 2006. A developer started Rust as a side project, and Mozilla gained enough interest in it to formally sponsor it The goal was to create a language that was highly performing with high safety guarantees, especially in regard to memory safety. After years of development, developers finally launched Rust 1.0 in 2015. Since then, various companies and communities have used it to achieve reliability without sacrificing speed. Why Developers are Loving It 1. Memory Safety Without a Garbage Collector One of the main attractions of Rust is that it has built a novel and fresh method for addressing memory. Whereas with C and C++ the memory is assigned and reclaimed manually by the developer, or in Java and Python it relies on garbage collection, Rust makes use of the model of ownership. With this system, memory is both effectively and safely managed at compile time, removing classes of typical bugs like null pointer dereferences, use-after-free, and data races. By enforcing borrowing and ownership rules strictly, Rust eliminates an entire class of bugs that are notoriously difficult to debug in other languages. That means fewer segmentation faults and no time wasted hunting for memory leaks. 2. Performance Comparable to C and C++ Rust is a compiled language that produces very optimized machine code and is near to C and C++ performance. As speedy as it is, it’s a top contender for system programming, game development, and other performance-critical applications. In contrast to garbage collection-halting languages, Rust provides deterministic runtime behavior and is therefore an ideal candidate for latency-critical applications. 3. Fearless Concurrency Concurrency is likely the most challenging area of contemporary software development. Rust’s ownership model extends to concurrency programming, where data races are detected at compile-time instead of leading to undefined behavior at runtime. The language enables one to use high-level abstractions like threads, async programming, and message-passing concurrency safely. 4. Developer-Friendly Tooling Rust’s ecosystem has a wealth of top-quality tools to enhance development. Cargo: Rust’s build system and dependency manager enable simple dependency management and compilation. Clippy: A built-in linting feature that catches common errors. Rustfmt: Helps enforce consistent code appearance across teams. Documentation Generation: Rust’s built-in documentation system makes it easy to generate well-structured docs directly from code comments. These tools assist in giving a more complete developer experience, so Rust is not just able but also enjoyable to work with. 5. Strong and Supportive Community The Rust community is famous for being friendly and helpful. The official Rust forums, Discord channels, and Reddit discussions are occupied by programmers who willingly share their knowledge. The programming language also enjoys a strong mentorship program and well-written documentation, making it easier to learn for newcomers. A Language Designed for Modern Development Rust was created with issues of modern software development in mind. Whether web assembly, embedded systems, or cloud-native applications, Rust has facets that appeal well to the demands of the day. With corporations such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google researching Rust for some of their projects, it’s clear that language will be part of future software development. Where It Is Being Used Web Development While Rust is not a traditional web development language, libraries like Rocket and Actix-web allow developers to build high-performance, secure web applications. Rust’s performance and safety make it an excellent backend language, especially when handling high-concurrency workloads. Embedded Systems Because of its low-level control and safety guarantees, Rust is becoming a popular choice for embedded programming. Companies working on firmware, IoT, and real-time operating systems are adopting Rust for its reliability and performance. Game Development Programmers need a language that combines speed with security. Rust offers both of them, along with libraries like Bevy and Amethyst that provide game development functionality similar to Unity or Unreal Engine. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Rust has been adopted by the likes of Solana and Polkadot because it is safe, fast, and can handle difficult concurrent operations. The correctness focus that the language is designed on also renders it a suitable choice for blockchain development whose security is of paramount importance. Operating Systems and Systems Programming Rust is also gaining popularity in systems programming. There even exist full-fledged operating systems written in Rust, such as the Redox OS. Microsoft even went far enough to experiment with re-compiling some elements of Windows with Rust for reasons of security and stability. Challenges of Learning Rust Despite its advantages, Rust is not without a learning curve. Developers who come from languages like Python or JavaScript do indeed struggle with Rust’s strict compiler rules and ownership model at first. Yet, once mastered, developers appreciate the power these give to code quality and security. Another difficulty is that Rust’s ecosystem while growing, is not yet as mature as more established languages such as Python or Java. Some libraries may not have the same level of documentation or support, but this is rapidly evolving as the language is used by more individuals. Is Rust the Future of Programming? Rust’s continuing development and adoption across use cases in various industries shows that Rust will reign over programming in the coming years. Its prowess at delivering safety without infringing on performance presents Rust as an excellent opportunity as a current form of software programming. As more companies tap into the positive aspect of applying Rust, the greater the chances are that future years will hold more extensive uses of it. If you’re a programmer looking to increase the value of your skills and safeguard your future career, studying Rust can be one of the best things you can do. Whether you’re building web apps, embedded systems, or high-performance software, Rust offers a mix of safety, performance, and programmer-centric features that few languages can equal. Final Thoughts Rust has turned into a force of revolution in the programming world. With its performance-focused and safe nature, supported by an open and growing community, it is a language with gigantic potential. Its rather steep learning curve aside, its long-term benefit in terms of code stability, concurrency safety, and system performance is gigantic. As companies continue to look out for solutions that are both scalable and secure, Rust’s value is going to grow steadily. Overall, Rust is not just a trend but also shows a larger shift towards the way applications are built nowadays. Its philosophy and its elements match quite well with the changing business and developer priorities, and as such, it is something that has to be seriously considered in the coming years. You recently started your AI journey and keep hearing terms like embeddings and encoding. These concepts are way more critical than you think. For instance, do you know LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek play with embeddings to understand your prompts? The ability to understand prompts dramatically depends on the quality of embeddings. Let’s explore why. In this article we will discuss about Embeddings and Embedding. What are Embeddings? In simple terms, embeddings are vector representations in a vector space. Embeddings are not limited to words, they can be of other inputs like sentences, images, and graphs. Embeddings represent high-dimensional data like texts and images into vectors of low dimension. With this, the task of processing this complex data becomes easier for models that only understand continuous numbers. Vectors are the key here. In computer science, vectors are represented in an array where [a] is a 1-dimensional vector, [a, b] is 2-dimensional, and so on. From a mathematical view, vectors can be added, which applies to embeddings too. Just like adding vectors gives us other vectors, adding embeddings will provide another embedding. Types of Embeddings: Word Embeddings: Word embeddings are vector representations of words in a vector space where each words are given a vector. In the vector space, related words are close to each other. Let’s say if “man” is represented with [0.5, 5.5, -0.7]. Since man and woman are semantically similar words, “woman” would have a vector embedding similar to it. Also, hereby performing arithmetic operations on such vectors, we can attain similar vectors. E.g “king” - “man” + “woman” = “queen”. Some popular models for word embeddings are Word2vec, GloVe, and FastText. Sentence Embeddings: Sentence embeddings are vector representations of whole sentences. Unlike word embeddings, the whole sentence is mapped in a vector space, and semantically similar sentences are closer in the vector space. Models like InferSent, and Doc2vec(extension of Word2vec) are used to generate sentence embeddings. Image Embeddings: Images can also be transformed into vectors, that is exactly what you’ll call image embeddings. CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are best for generating image embeddings, which are later used for tasks like image classification and image retrieval. Audio and speech Embeddings: Audio and speech embeddings are generated by converting the raw audio and speech data into vectors that can be suitable for tasks like speech recognition and emotion detection. VGGish and Wav2vect are models dedicated to such embeddings. Why do we need Embeddings? The problem with raw, categorical, or high-dimensional data Before embeddings were ubiquitous, encoding techniques like one-hot encoding were used to represent categorical variables. However, this technique has limitations. Let’s say we have a small vocabulary of 5 words: “ Cat “, “ dog “, “ fish “, “ bird “, “ horse “ One-hot encoding works by generating a binary representation for each class where the position corresponding to the word is represented by 1. So we get a representation similar to the table below. Such representations are called sparse vectors, and these were the foundations for early word embedding techniques. So this works fine for a small number of classes, but what if we have all the words in the English language? How big will this table be? So big that the computation will be too high and messy. Not only that, while extracting the semantics out of words, the model will be confused. This problem is solved by embeddings, which are also called dense vectors. The embeddings not only numerically represent but are also able to capture the semantics of words by introducing a distance concept where words with similar semantics have a very small distance. For similarity measurements, cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and several others can be used. Real World Applications Embeddings have become foundational across NLP, recommendation systems, and computer vision. Their power lies in transforming raw, high-dimensional data into dense vectors that encode contextual, semantic, or behavioral relationships, enabling machines to reason more effectively about language, users, and visual content. Text Search: Embeddings are key for any retrieval tasks that involve retrieving similar documents based on a given query. Embeddings and embedding models are a crucial part of the RAG( Retrieval Augmented Generation) architecture, which is a great approach to prevent LLMs from hallucination. Recommendation system: In a recommendation system, whether it’s for movies, food, or clothes, embedding models are used to represent them in vectors. They are stored in a vector space and can be compared to recommend similar ones. Sentiment Analysis: Sentiments are very abstract for models to detect, but using embeddings and capturing sentiment-related features can ease the process. Positive words or sentences have similar embeddings, which can differentiate them from negative word embeddings. Evolution of Embedding Models From one-hot to word2vec: One-hot encoding was the most primitive way of representing words in a vector, where only the corresponding word was represented as one and others as zeros. This approach was succeeded by TF-IDF (Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency) in an attempt to capture the importance of words based on their frequency in a document(sentences or phrases) and across all the documents. Sparck Jones proposed it in his paper “A Statistical Interpretation of term specificity and its application in retrieval.” TF-IDF captured more useful information than one-hot encoding, but still could not capture the semantics. Word2vec was a revolutionary technique first proposed in a paper titled “Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space”. It was suggested by Tomas Mikolov and colleagues at Google and published in 2013. Similalry, it uses a shallow neural network to capture the linguistic context of words from a large corpus of text. It produces an embedding that maps words to a vector space, typically of a few hundred dimensions. Cosine Similarity is used to measure the similarity between the embeddings. Static Vs Contextual Embedding Models Models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText are effective at generating dense vector representations of words, known as embeddings, which capture semantic relationships. Word2Vec, in particular, learns these embeddings using one of two architectures: CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) or Skip-gram. However, the embeddings produced by these models are static, meaning each word has a single representation regardless of context. As a result, they struggle with polysemy-where a word has multiple meanings. For example, they cannot distinguish between the word bat in the sentences: “He bought a new bat to play cricket.” “Bat flies at night.” Contextual nuances are lost because the embedding is based solely on word co-occurrence statistics in a fixed window of text, rather than the full context of a sentence. In such scenarios, a contextualized model like BERT( Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) excels where word embeddings are generated based on the context of surrounding words. BERT’s bidirectionality allows it to look for context at both the left and right context of a word during training. So, the embeddings BERT produces are contextual, that is, words can have different embeddings based on their context. This makes it very powerful in generating robust embeddings that can retain contextualized semantics. Key Challenges and Limitations Embedding models is a game-changing concept, but it has ethical considerations. The models may learn the bias in the training data that can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in their applications. So, realizing and mitigating such bias becomes a crucial part of developing a safe and ethical AI system. Bias in Embeddings: Textual data that human produces are inherently biased. So, while training embedding models to learn the semantics and contexts, such bias gets slipped. A common example is associating “doctors” with males and “nurses” with females, reflecting societal stereotypes. These biases can lead to unfairness and discrimination in real-world applications like a recommendation system or a hiring system. To mitigate such biases, techniques like debiasing embeddings can be adapted, which remove or neutralize biased dimensions. Regular testing for bias and fairness while introducing diverse and representative training data is a must. Transparency and Accountability: Transparency and accountability are another aspect that needs to be considered while dealing with embedding models. The advanced embedding model represents data in dimensions that range in the hundreds, which is incomprehensible and affects the outcomes of AI systems. Hence, developers should focus on being transparent about training data and the choice of models. Conclusion Embedding models are the cornerstone of modern AI that allows powerful models to process high dimensional data which was previously impossible. The evolution of word embeddings from Word2Vect and GloVe to state-of-the-art models like BERT and GPT has enabled new possibilities in NLP, computer vision, and recommendation systems. As current models start to evolve and shape the world, it becomes inevitable to understand embedding models. Understanding their use cases equips us to build powerful AI systems that transform conventional tasks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a hot topic in the tech industry, with opinions ranging from it being a revolutionary boom to a potential doom. It has raised a big question: Artificial Intelligence dilemma, a shortcut or a Roadblock? AI has undeniably transformed the field of technology, significantly speeding up development processes. Before the advent of Artificial Intelligence(AI) tools, developing a full-stack web application could take over a month. Now, with clear requirements, it can be accomplished in less than a week. This acceleration is indeed fascinating, especially for senior developers who can leverage AI to enhance their productivity. However, the impact of AI on junior developers is a different story. While AI tools offer a quick path to creating sophisticated applications, they also pose a significant risk: over-reliance. Junior developers, who are just entering the tech field, may become too dependent on these tools, potentially hindering their long-term growth and understanding of fundamental concepts. The Artificial Intelligence Dilemma: Efficiency vs. Learning Imagine two developers, a junior and a senior tasked with building a full-stack e-commerce web application. The junior developer is allowed to use any AI tool, while the senior developer must rely solely on their technical skills, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and other resources. Initially, the junior developer’s application might appear more polished and feature-rich. However, the true test comes when both are asked to make small changes without the aid of AI tools. The junior developer, accustomed to AI assistance, might struggle to implement these changes efficiently and bug-free. In contrast, the senior developer, with a deep understanding of the fundamentals, can make the necessary adjustments smoothly. This scenario highlights a critical issue: Junior developers may be skipping essential learning steps by relying too heavily on AI tools. The Importance of Fundamentals One of the major problems observed in junior developers today is a lack of interest in learning the fundamentals. They often want to jump straight into advanced topics and tools without building a strong foundation. This approach can lead to a superficial understanding of technology, making it difficult to troubleshoot issues or adapt to new challenges without AI assistance. The Future of Software Development Despite the concerns, it’s unlikely that software developers or engineers will lose their jobs to AI. Instead, Artificial Intelligence will likely change the workflow, making processes more efficient. The role of a software engineer might evolve, but it won’t be replaced by AI entirely. The idea of “Software Engineer 2.0” being synonymous with “Machine Learning Engineer” is a misconception. The future will still require developers with a solid grasp of fundamentals, who can use AI tools as an enhancement rather than a crutch. Adapting to the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven workforce A recent study conducted by Pearson, in partnership with ServiceNow, provides an extensive analysis of the potential effects of AI and automation on the economies of six countries (U.S., UK, Germany, India, Australia, and Japan) and how technology-based roles are expected to evolve. Despite concern from potentially affected groups, this research shows that junior application developers will remain valuable even as AI continues to evolve. The study suggests that in the coming years, those junior developers who can understand and adapt to their new roles will be best prepared to thrive in the AI-driven workforce of the future. The rise of AI and automation significantly impacts the skills required for junior developers to succeed in the tech industry. By analyzing their workflows and identifying areas where automation can provide the most significant value, developers can implement automation tools and processes, freeing time for more complex work. Project-based learning is a popular and effective way for new developers to gain hands-on experience and apply their coding skills to real-world challenges. However, this approach also presents its own set of unique challenges. Many new developers encounter pitfalls, but mastering code quality can set them apart in a competitive industry. Conclusion AI tools offer tremendous potential for accelerating development and enhancing productivity. However, for junior developers, over-reliance on these tools can be a double-edged sword. While they provide a quick path to creating complex applications, they can also hinder the learning of essential fundamentals. The key is to strike a balance: use AI tools to augment your skills, but never at the expense of understanding the core principles of software development. By doing so, junior developers can grow into well-rounded, competent professionals capable of adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer Sci-Fi, it’s here, transforming industries, and AI in healthcare is one of the most promising yet complex domains it’s reshaping. From detecting cancer in medical scans to predicting strokes before they occur, AI has the potential to make healthcare faster, more efficient, and more precise. But alongside these advancements come technical hurdles, ethical dilemmas, and critical questions about how much control we should give to algorithms in life-and-death decisions. So, what does the future of AI in healthcare look like? Let’s explore. The Promise of AI in Healthcare AI in medicine is like having a supercharged doctor with a photographic memory and lightning-fast thinking. It’s already changing the game, spotting diseases like Alzheimer’s and breast cancer earlier and more accurately than ever. Hospitals are using AI to cut down ER wait times and manage resources better, while in drug discovery, breakthroughs like DeepMind’s AlphaFold are rewriting the rules of protein research. Imagine taking a pill crafted exclusively for you designed to target your condition with laser precision, minimize side effects, and accelerate recovery. That’s the promise of personalized medicine. At a biomedical hackathon at Kathmandu University, I got a deep dive into human genetics and discovered how genetic sequencing, protein interactions, and biomarker analysis could unlock this future. Of course, challenges like data privacy and algorithmic bias remain, but one thing is clear-AI is revolutionizing healthcare in the best way possible. Key Challenges in Implementation of AI in HealthCare With great power comes great responsibility-and AI in healthcare is the Spider-Man of modern medicine. It’s got all this dazzling potential, but sorry, folks, it’s not as easy as flicking an “on” switch and calling it a day. AI depends on vast amounts of high-quality data, but medical records are often scattered, incomplete, or trapped in outdated systems. When AI feeds on bad data, it produces unreliable predictions, leading to potential misdiagnoses and treatment errors. The challenge isn’t just collecting data but ensuring it is accurate, standardized, and accessible. Then there’s the cost challenge. Developing and implementing AI isn’t inexpensive-it takes a significant investment for hospitals to bring it on board. Smaller clinics and less-funded regions often can’t keep up, watching from the sidelines as larger institutions adopt the technology. This isn’t just unfortunate-it could deepen the gap in healthcare access, where advanced AI tools are mostly available to well-resourced facilities. Patient care shouldn’t feel exclusive, should it? Then there’s the issue of trust. Doctors aren’t always eager to embrace algorithms-they’ve spent years building their expertise through hands-on experience, not managing software. Many view AI with skepticism, unsure of its role in their practice. Without thorough training and clear evidence that AI supports rather than replaces their judgment, adoption will likely remain gradual. AI’s role in healthcare must be that of an assistant, not an authority-augmenting human expertise rather than attempting to replace it. The potential? Oh, it’s huge -AI could be the rockstar of healthcare. But if we don’t tackle these hiccups, it might just end up as another overhyped gadget gathering dust in the corner. Ethical Concerns Beyond technical and financial barriers, AI in healthcare raises serious ethical questions. Let’s ensure this revolution succeeds, time to address the challenges thoughtfully and focus on effective solutions! Privacy and Data Security AI requires access to extensive patient data to function effectively, but this poses risks. Medical records contain highly sensitive information-who controls access, and how can we ensure data remains secure? Patients deserve transparency and strict safeguards against breaches or misuse. Bias and Fairness AI systems learn from old data, and sometimes that data has a few sneaky flaws. If it shortchanges certain groups, the AI might not treat everyone fairly. Case in point: one fancy AI once underestimated Black patients’ needs because it was fed healthcare spending stats that weren’t quite balanced. Fixing these little hiccups is a must to keep AI healthcare fair for all. Accountability and Trust When AI makes a medical error, who is responsible-the doctor, the developer, or the algorithm itself? Unlike human professionals, AI cannot explain its reasoning in a way we always understand, making accountability difficult. Trust in AI requires transparency, rigorous testing, and the ability for healthcare providers to interpret and validate AI recommendations. NeuroVision: A Case Study in Responsible AI Development One project that highlights AI’s potential, when developed responsibly, is NeuroVision. This initiative uses AI to classify brain tumors from DICOM medical images, based on a proposed technical architecture that integrates deep learning models with cloud-based processing for improved speed and accuracy. The dataset for this system is developed using Functional APIs, which enable efficient handling and structuring of complex medical imaging data. If implemented with proper ethical considerations, it could significantly enhance early tumor detection, leading to faster diagnoses and improved treatment planning. However, for NeuroVision to succeed ethically, several factors must be addressed: Data Transparency & Security : Ensuring patient imaging data is handled with the highest standards of encryption and privacy protection. Bias Mitigation : Training the model on diverse datasets to avoid racial, gender, or socioeconomic disparities in diagnosis. Explainability : Implementing explainable AI (XAI) techniques to help radiologists understand why the AI reached a particular conclusion, rather than treating it as a “black box.” Collaboration with Medical Experts : Ensuring that NeuroVision remains a tool that assists radiologists rather than replaces them, maintaining human oversight in critical decisions. If developed with these ethical pillars in mind, NeuroVision could set an example for responsible AI integration in healthcare, proving that innovation and responsibility can go hand in hand. The Road Ahead: Balancing Innovation and Responsibility The future of AI in healthcare all comes down to finding that sweet spot. We need strong rules to make sure AI plays fair, owns up to its mistakes, and keeps our data safe. And let’s be real-transparency matters. If patients and doctors can’t figure out how AI comes up with its answers, they’re not going to trust it, plain and simple. The trick is teamwork. AI techies, doctors, ethicists, and policymakers have to join forces to build systems that aren’t just cutting-edge but also decent and focused on people. Think of it like a three-legged stool: you’ve got innovation, responsibility, and trust holding it up. Kick one out, and the whole thing comes crashing down. The good news? We’re already seeing some wins. A few hospitals are testing out AI that explains itself, governments are sketching out ethics rules, and researchers are digging into the messy stuff like bias and fairness. Still, we’ve got a ways to go-nobody said this would be a quick fix! Conclusion AI could shake up healthcare-think of quicker diagnoses, sharper treatments, and healthier vibes all around. But let’s not kid ourselves: tech isn’t some magic fix-it wand. It’s more like a trusty tool, and we’ve got to use it right. The point isn’t to swap out doctors for robots-it’s to give them a boost so they can help us better. So, here’s the big question: Can we make sure AI’s got humanity’s back without messing up on ethics, fairness, or trust? If cool projects like NeuroVision show us how to do AI the responsible way, I’d say we’ve got a solid shot at a “heck yes.” What’s your take where do we set the boundaries?

Blogs As we are getting more technology exposure here in Nepal, a lot of new methods and changes have been seen in multiple. But not quite much in the banking sector. As smartphones are now available almost all over the country, it is no surprise that Artificial Intelligence is also starting to pop here. However, like technology, Nepal’s banking sector has been slower compared to other sectors. Banks in Nepal, while modernizing and adopting new techniques, are still hesitant to fully accept AI. This is mainly due to the terms of infrastructure regulation, and trust. But as Nepal’s financial services sector continues to evolve, AI offers multiple services: personalized services and many more. It also offers smarter risk management and more secure transaction processes. So let’s see and explore why the banking sector is slow in this trend. Similarly, let’s explore what opportunity this technology holds, and how we can benefit from this system. The Challenge of AI Adoption in Nepal’s Banking Sector Regulatory and Compliance Concerns Nepal’s banking system operates under a strict regulatory framework. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank of Nepal, closely monitors financial institutions. Additionally, it ensures the safety and security of customer deposits and financial systems. While there are regulations regarding AI being adopted globally at a slow pace, Nepal’s banking sector is particularly cautious. This is due to the lack of clear guidelines on how to implement AI technologies within the confines of its regulatory environment. For instance, the NRB’s existing regulation, which focuses mainly on traditional banking methods, might not fully be compatible with the data-driven nature of AI. With AI systems relying heavily on data, including sensitive customer information, its compliance with NEpal’s privacy act and others becomes even more complex. Therefore there is a rooted hesitation in implementing AI solutions as the main concern is data security and regulatory oversight. 1. Data Security and Privacy As said, Data Security remains a concerning topic and a top priority for Banks. As AI requires large datasets to function effectively, the risk of security breaches and data misuse is a growing concern. It is also to be noted that Nepal’s Banking system is often targeted by cybercriminals and this kind of news on people’s data being breached or leaked is common. To reduce this an AI should have a secure system to mitigate threats like fraud, hacking, and identity theft. In Nepal where the digital payment system is just a new innovative step compared to other countries who have already introduced this system years ago and yet still begot one or two problems in the well-established payment system we use today. Now, introducing AI to this field and trusting that AI’s ability to keep personal and financial data is very hard. To do this we will require time and a lot of data to train the model. Additionally meeting the demand of both customers and regulators in the process is also important. 2. Infrastructure and Legacy Systems Many banks in Nepal still operate on legacy traditional systems. The systems are not designed to integrate with the advanced features of AI. Unlike other countries where banks have new cutting-edge technology, Nepali financial institutions often operate on older core banking systems. The cost and risk of upgrading this system can be problematic, especially for smaller or regional banks. Additionally, the high quantity data for training ML models, is a hectic process here as majority of data collection , storage and sharing are oftenfragmented which creates another roadblock for Ai-driven solution. As a result, banks are very serious and cautious in the approach of Ai integration and monthly reluctant to overhaul the existing system that they are comfortable with. 3. Skill Gap AI itself is a new concept introduced in Nepal. The skills required to develop and manage AI are thus limited here. While there has been growth in the tech industry, the specialized knowledge needed to operate AI-driven tools. But in the banking sector or any other sector, such tools are quite limited. Data Scientists, machine learning engineers, and Ai specialists are in high demand globally, and Nepal’s banking sector faces the same shortage of talents. The Opportunities of AI in Nepal’s Banking Sector Despite these challenges, the potential for Ai in Nepal’s banking sector is huge, and here is how Ai can make a difference: 1. Personalized Banking Services The Nepalese banking sector focuses on customer service enhancement as mobile banking services expand their reach to residents of urban and rural Nepal. The implementation of AI enables Nepali banks to deliver customized products that specifically address the personal requirements of their individual customers. AI-powered chatbots provide round-the-clock customer support facilities that handle inquiries and transactions alongside personalized financial recommendations based on user spending behavior. The increase in Nepali consumers choosing mobile and digital banking platforms will drive escalated requirements for personalized banking services across the industry. AI systems examine financial records in combination with payment behaviors and societal indicators to customize financial services that let users improve their money management strategies. 2. Fraud Detection and Prevention The growth of digital banking across Nepal has produced intensified banking fraud cases affecting the industry. Artificial intelligence functions as a reliable instrument to both find and halt fraudulent behavior. AI leverages real-time transaction analysis through machine learning algorithms to spot unexpected spending activities which then allows it to notify bank customers or the institution before major financial losses occur. AI technology assists Nepali banks to discover credit card abuse together with money laundering and identity theft leading to enhanced cybersecurity protection. The implementation of AI would deliver necessary security measures when Nepali banks plan to expand their digital services. 3. Operational Efficiency Bank institutions throughout Nepal together with international financial institutions seek continuous methods to minimize operational costs and enhance operational efficiency. The implementation of AI solutions enables banks to execute repetitive duties like data recording together with loan analysis while running credit ratings besides checking against industry regulations. The implementation of AI leads banks to achieve better operational efficiency with reduced costs. The Nepalese banking system which maintains mostly manual and paper-intensive services can experience rapid progress thanks to AI applications. Benefits from this approach would improve the customer journey while simultaneously lowering both operational expenses and human-related service shortcomings. Conclusion The banking sector in Nepal is approaching an era of artificial intelligence transformation. The banking sector of Nepal faces ongoing challenges linked to regulatory checkpoints and limited infrastructure. In addition to the shortage of capable personnel but the promise of AI to enhance customer service and operations exists in direct proportion to its capacity to boost security measures. Future improvements in Nepal’s digital environment will make artificial intelligence essential for banking organizations. It will make us want to stay competitive while serving customers who use technology. The banking sector in Nepal will adapt AI capabilities at a moderate pace given that future prospects appear positive. If Nepal’s financial institutions establish plans, gain regulatory certainty and prioritize data security then they can use AI to develop an efficient banking system that is centered on customer needs and secured operations. Introduction Optical character recognition is the key to document process automation in today’s digital world, as it allows machines to read printed and handwritten texts. Although OCR has made significant progress in some major languages such as English, Chinese, and Spanish, it remains a great challenge to low-resource languages, which do not have a digital dataset of their own and NLP resources. This article will discover how recent AI and deep learning advancements are revolutionizing low-resource language OCR for low-resource languages. Its implementation in low-resource languages has remained only a dream until the recent advancement and breakthrough in AI and deep learning. This is going to bring a new possibility for OCR with low-resource languages, which may revolutionize the sectors of government documentation, historical text digitization, and financial automation in regions of these languages, and hence large-prevailing areas, among others. He then proceeds to explain the challenges of OCR in low-resource languages, elaborating on the very recent advancement in AI-driven OCR and how it is impacting automation across different industries. Understanding Low-Resource Languages in OCR What Are Low-Resource Languages? Low-resourced languages are those languages that normally lack large-scale annotated data, clean and robust linguistic resources (such as dictionaries and corpora), labeled training data, and, more than anything, powerful and well-supported research in computational linguistics. Some of the most famous examples are Nepali, Sinhala, and Amharic; in general, local, indigenous languages that do not have large communities developed around them. While languages such as English or Chinese have billions of texts available in digital form, such languages often suffer from a lack of labeled text data to train an OCR system. OCR and Its Role in Automation OCR is the technology to convert the hard-copy or scanned text into a machine-readable format. It’s applied in wide areas such as: Document digitization (scanning books, archives, historical records) Automated processing of invoices and receipts (financial automation) Automatic data entry in government and enterprise workflows Assistive support technologies like reading tools for the visually impaired OCR systems include Google Tesseract for high-resource languages, ABBYY FineReader, Amazon Textract, and several others. OCR systems like Google Tesseract work very well for high-resource languages. Still, for low-resource languages, the efficiency of the tools described above depends primarily on the data available and is therefore often associated with low accuracy because there is a scarcity of this data, combined with complex scripts and various handwriting styles. Challenges in OCR for Low-Resource Languages Lack of High-Quality Training Data OCR models inherently require thousands to millions of labeled text image pairs for effective training. In most low-resource languages, there is already a lack of digitized books, newspapers, etc., which further hampers training a good OCR model. Texts from books and newspapers available in low-resource languages are mostly turn of the century with highly deteriorated quality. It is, therefore, a big problem for the straightening and orderly OCR training model. Complex and Unique Scripts Written low-resource languages are generally non-Latin scripts, which pose a big challenge to any OCR engine. This might be associated with: Devanagari script (used in Nepali, Hindi, and Marathi) with character formations that are very tough Ethiopic script found in Amharic, which has many unique glyphs Also, Brahmic scripts are associated with ligatures and stacked letters. The traditional OCR models fail to yield good results on these scripts, especially when it comes to recognizing handwritten text. Poorly Scanned, Noisy Data Most of the documents written in low-resource languages have been scanned from deteriorated, old, and dirty sources and could have ink smudges, faded text, torn pages, or mixed text of different languages within the same document. Some of them may not have uniform font or space, which will make the OCR system much less accurate compared to those in high-resource languages. Lack of NLP Support for Post-Processing OCR is sometimes dependent on the NLP models, which help in better output correction for spell and grammar checking, etc. Since low-resourced languages suffer from the problem of missing pre-trained NLP models, OCR systems often fail to correct errors in the extracted text effectively. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning: The New Wave in OCR Automation The use of deep learning research in OCR models supported by artificial intelligence has been engaged in automating text extraction in under-resourced languages. This is one of the main methods they achieve this. Self-Supervised and Few-Shot Learning Instead of having to depend on huge labeled datasets, the AI models are now learning by being: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-The models learn from unlabelled data in large corpora at the input level like raw text or images. Few-Shot Learning-is to learn patterns based on very small data points, of course, instrumental for rare languages, an example of it being Facebook’s SeamlessM4T model using self-supervised learning to enhance multilingual text recognition - even in languages with less data. Advanced techniques - Transformer-Based OCR Models In the earlier days, OCRs used to be either rule-based or statistical. The modern OCR engines now have transformer models like Tesseract 5.0, TrOCR (pre-trains on high-resource languages and fine-tunes for low-resource languages) from Microsoft, and PaddleOCR (allows users to train custom models for rare scripts). Data Augmentation Techniques Some data augmentation strategies applied by the researchers due to limited labeled datasets include: GANs for generating synthetic data of text images in low-resource languages Rotating, distorting, or blurring text images in the training data to enhance the robustness of OCR. Example: Working on the Sanskrit OCR Project at Google involved extensive work to fix character recognition in ancient manuscripts, for which synthetic text generation had to be used. Cloud OCR Approaches and Edge OCR Enterprises are implementing OCR engines with cloud and mobile edge-computing solutions to enable more universally accessible OCR. Cloud-based OCR services-Google Vision API, and Microsoft Azure OCR-have added support for more low-resource languages. Edge computing enables OCR models on low-power devices, such as smartphones, to automate at scale Ways to Automate OCR in Low-Resource Languages Since AI-OCR is getting strengthened, there are a few significant ways in which OCR can drive automation: In the Federal and Public Administration: Decision-making statement automation for the process of paper-based documents for office work Birth certificates, records of land, and legal forms got scanned to keep in digital format Facilitated automatic document verification to assess citizens in remote areas. In Finance and Banking OCR can process invoices in cheques and in any local language. Digitization of receipts and tax documents for small businesses Preservation of Historical and Cultural OCR proves helpful for scanning old manuscripts and digitizing them; therefore, they can be preserved. OCR helps preserve old texts and manuscripts by conversion to a digital format, thus preserving endangered languages and cultures. AI Assistants and Chatbots OCR can extract the content of documents to power assistant-driven AI. Translate handwritten content into any language The Future of OCR in Low-Resource Languages It has been noted that AI and deep learning have opened up new possibilities for OCR in low-resource languages where automation was not so easy. While the challenges stay-limited datasets, script complexity, and noisy input-new techniques are coming up to improve the accuracy of the procedure. As OCR for low-resource languages gets more reliable, this will allow for the automation of government services, financial processing, cultural preservation, and educational fields. It is this technology that is going to bridge the digital gap by relaying all languages, no matter how rare they are, into beneficiaries of the power of AI-driven automation. This technology is going to be the start of a brand new future where all languages, no matter how rare, are going to benefit from the power of AI-driven automation. The future of OCR is not only with reading text but with digitalizing every language. At the moment cyber-attacks along with data breaches are growing more and more sophisticated by the day. The search for new ways of protecting our very own personal data has never been more critical. Cue biometric authentication new technology is a game-changer in the cyber security field. Spanning from fingerprinting to face scanning and iris scanning, biometric security solutions present a more secure and more convenient alternative. It is replacing and working as an alternative of passwords and PINs. However, as with any emerging tech, the use of biometrics raises serious privacy issues. Additionally, it also raised ethical questions regarding the overall use of biometrics. The Era of Biometric Security (Biometric Authentication) Biometrics is the act of recording our unique physical characteristics. Additionally, it might be a fingerprint, the contours of our face. It also may be the hue of the iris, for instance, we can use it as a form of identification. It is pilfered or lost. Biometrics is an authentication that physically ties to the biology of a human person. Biometric authentication is hard to duplicate. Facial recognition has been so popular because it is easy to use and easy to implement on daily devices. Phones, laptops, and even residential security systems use facial recognition to provide access. Today, it is also an easy and convenient method for consumers to unlock devices. Similarly, fingerprint readers, now ubiquitous on smartphones, are integrated into larger platforms. This will offer a secure and convenient method of verification. Similarly, for even more forward thinkers, there is iris scan technology. The technology provides yet another layer of security, imaging the patterns unique to the eye’s iris to verify identities. These technologies are widely viewed as a possible answer to the long-standing issue of password management. As cyber-attacks become more advanced password files get compromised daily. This leads users to find it difficult to practice good security hygiene. With biometrics, users should not remember complex combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols-they only need to be themselves. The Promise of Biometrics for Online Security The biggest advantage of biometric authentication is being able to create an even higher level of security. Passwords are either weak, used on more than one website, or just plain guessed easily. People use simple phrases or information easily found on the web. Biometrics are much more difficult to replicate. Even if the hacker manages to get your password or PIN, they would require your unique biological characteristics to breach the system. Furthermore, biometric systems are fast and convenient. Opening one’s phone with a quick scan of the individual’s fingerprint or glancing at one’s phone for facial scanning is normal. This kind of convenience can come with the ability to remove a significant amount of friction from users, allowing them to safely log in to online services without having to recall passwords or undergo multiple-step authentication processes. Furthermore, biometric systems can be multi-factor in nature. For instance, a device can require both a fingerprint and a face scan, which adds a layer of protection that isn’t possible with passwords. Since online threats are not demonstrating any indication of decelerating, layered security in the form of biometrics could prove to be one of the most robust protections on hand to combat cybercrime. Privacy Concerns: The Dark Side of Biometric Data For all their potential benefits, biometric systems aren’t without some very legitimate concerns of all of which are those having to do with privacy. Biometric authentication captures and stores a person’s own biological data by its very nature. Unlike a password, which we can change if someone compromises it, we cannot change our fingerprint, face, or iris. Because they are fixed and permanent. If hackers steal or someone mismanages that data, the consequences can be much worse One of the greatest risks is centralized biometric storage. When we login with biometrics, the information is kept on a server or in the cloud. When these databases are compromised by the attackers, they will not just obtain usernames and passwords but also very personal and irreversible data. Unwanted access to this kind of sensitive data could lead to identity theft, fraud, or blackmail. Another concern is the use of surveillance. Facial recognition software has been specifically aimed at application in public areas where people are unaware of being photographed. Governments and non-governmental agencies are using the systems to monitor individuals’ movements, activities, and even political affiliations. Though proponents have argued that it can be used in ways that might make us safer (e.g., to arrest criminals or deter terrorist attacks), others view it as an insidious threat to privacy and a tool for totalitarian oppression. In addition, their accuracy is an issue as well. They can have false positives and false negatives, thus giving unauthorized individuals access or not giving authorized individuals access. The study has determined that facial recognition software, for instance, has been found to operate at a higher rate of errors in identifying females and minorities, bringing about issues regarding the fairness and reliability of these technologies. Balancing Security and Privacy As with any technology progress, the issue with turning biometric authentication into a success is achieving the correct balance between security and privacy. To prevent such systems from being an evil empire, there must be strict regulation and protection mechanisms. Biometric information is encrypted and protected, and people should be in a position to delete or revoke access to their information at their discretion. Transparency about collection and usage of the biometric information will be most important to win consumers’ trust. The second important step is to design biometric systems that are equitable. The developers need to remove biases in facial recognition and other biometric systems so that they function as equally effectively with all populations of people. This will prevent discrimination. similarly, it also makes the population discriminatorily untargeted or excluded by the system. Last, users must be cognizant and careful of the technologies used. With any authentication method, it is intelligent to be knowledgeable of the risks and take measures to protect personal data. Whether activating multi-factor authentication, using encrypted apps, or selecting services with better privacy settings, users have to do something when it pertains to their cyber security. Conclusion: The Future of Biometric Authentication Biometric authentication is quite possibly the key to the cyber security revolution, with newer, quicker, safer methods of access to our data. Going forward, as technology will undoubtedly continue to improve, even new methods of authentication will emerge, such as voice or even DNA scanning. With all of the innovation, however, we need to be careful not to miss the privacy risk. Finally, the future of biometric security will be in our own hands, as we decide to balance the delicate trade-off between convenience, security, and privacy. With regulatory control, ethical innovation, and transparency as a priority, biometric authentication could well be the answer to a safer online existence. But with every innovation, we must move cautiously lest we mortgage privacy on the altar of convenience in a way we would later regret. Over the past ten years, Rust grew from an experimental project to one of the globe’s best-loved programming languages. Stack Overflow polls have demonstrated its popularity among programmers every year. It has consistently ranked as the ‘most loved’ language for several consecutive years. But are programmers truly so in love with this language? Why do engineers-from amateurs to industrial-scale professionals-keep choosing this language? Especially when so many others are competing in the same space?Today’s blog will delve into what makes this language so popular, its standout features, and how it has been able to etch itself a distinctive niche in contemporary software development. A Brief History Rust was a side project from Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare in 2006. A developer started Rust as a side project, and Mozilla gained enough interest in it to formally sponsor it The goal was to create a language that was highly performing with high safety guarantees, especially in regard to memory safety. After years of development, developers finally launched Rust 1.0 in 2015. Since then, various companies and communities have used it to achieve reliability without sacrificing speed. Why Developers are Loving It 1. Memory Safety Without a Garbage Collector One of the main attractions of Rust is that it has built a novel and fresh method for addressing memory. Whereas with C and C++ the memory is assigned and reclaimed manually by the developer, or in Java and Python it relies on garbage collection, Rust makes use of the model of ownership. With this system, memory is both effectively and safely managed at compile time, removing classes of typical bugs like null pointer dereferences, use-after-free, and data races. By enforcing borrowing and ownership rules strictly, Rust eliminates an entire class of bugs that are notoriously difficult to debug in other languages. That means fewer segmentation faults and no time wasted hunting for memory leaks. 2. Performance Comparable to C and C++ Rust is a compiled language that produces very optimized machine code and is near to C and C++ performance. As speedy as it is, it’s a top contender for system programming, game development, and other performance-critical applications. In contrast to garbage collection-halting languages, Rust provides deterministic runtime behavior and is therefore an ideal candidate for latency-critical applications. 3. Fearless Concurrency Concurrency is likely the most challenging area of contemporary software development. Rust’s ownership model extends to concurrency programming, where data races are detected at compile-time instead of leading to undefined behavior at runtime. The language enables one to use high-level abstractions like threads, async programming, and message-passing concurrency safely. 4. Developer-Friendly Tooling Rust’s ecosystem has a wealth of top-quality tools to enhance development. Cargo: Rust’s build system and dependency manager enable simple dependency management and compilation. Clippy: A built-in linting feature that catches common errors. Rustfmt: Helps enforce consistent code appearance across teams. Documentation Generation: Rust’s built-in documentation system makes it easy to generate well-structured docs directly from code comments. These tools assist in giving a more complete developer experience, so Rust is not just able but also enjoyable to work with. 5. Strong and Supportive Community The Rust community is famous for being friendly and helpful. The official Rust forums, Discord channels, and Reddit discussions are occupied by programmers who willingly share their knowledge. The programming language also enjoys a strong mentorship program and well-written documentation, making it easier to learn for newcomers. A Language Designed for Modern Development Rust was created with issues of modern software development in mind. Whether web assembly, embedded systems, or cloud-native applications, Rust has facets that appeal well to the demands of the day. With corporations such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google researching Rust for some of their projects, it’s clear that language will be part of future software development. Where It Is Being Used Web Development While Rust is not a traditional web development language, libraries like Rocket and Actix-web allow developers to build high-performance, secure web applications. Rust’s performance and safety make it an excellent backend language, especially when handling high-concurrency workloads. Embedded Systems Because of its low-level control and safety guarantees, Rust is becoming a popular choice for embedded programming. Companies working on firmware, IoT, and real-time operating systems are adopting Rust for its reliability and performance. Game Development Programmers need a language that combines speed with security. Rust offers both of them, along with libraries like Bevy and Amethyst that provide game development functionality similar to Unity or Unreal Engine. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Rust has been adopted by the likes of Solana and Polkadot because it is safe, fast, and can handle difficult concurrent operations. The correctness focus that the language is designed on also renders it a suitable choice for blockchain development whose security is of paramount importance. Operating Systems and Systems Programming Rust is also gaining popularity in systems programming. There even exist full-fledged operating systems written in Rust, such as the Redox OS. Microsoft even went far enough to experiment with re-compiling some elements of Windows with Rust for reasons of security and stability. Challenges of Learning Rust Despite its advantages, Rust is not without a learning curve. Developers who come from languages like Python or JavaScript do indeed struggle with Rust’s strict compiler rules and ownership model at first. Yet, once mastered, developers appreciate the power these give to code quality and security. Another difficulty is that Rust’s ecosystem while growing, is not yet as mature as more established languages such as Python or Java. Some libraries may not have the same level of documentation or support, but this is rapidly evolving as the language is used by more individuals. Is Rust the Future of Programming? Rust’s continuing development and adoption across use cases in various industries shows that Rust will reign over programming in the coming years. Its prowess at delivering safety without infringing on performance presents Rust as an excellent opportunity as a current form of software programming. As more companies tap into the positive aspect of applying Rust, the greater the chances are that future years will hold more extensive uses of it. If you’re a programmer looking to increase the value of your skills and safeguard your future career, studying Rust can be one of the best things you can do. Whether you’re building web apps, embedded systems, or high-performance software, Rust offers a mix of safety, performance, and programmer-centric features that few languages can equal. Final Thoughts Rust has turned into a force of revolution in the programming world. With its performance-focused and safe nature, supported by an open and growing community, it is a language with gigantic potential. Its rather steep learning curve aside, its long-term benefit in terms of code stability, concurrency safety, and system performance is gigantic. As companies continue to look out for solutions that are both scalable and secure, Rust’s value is going to grow steadily. Overall, Rust is not just a trend but also shows a larger shift towards the way applications are built nowadays. Its philosophy and its elements match quite well with the changing business and developer priorities, and as such, it is something that has to be seriously considered in the coming years. You recently started your AI journey and keep hearing terms like embeddings and encoding. These concepts are way more critical than you think. For instance, do you know LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek play with embeddings to understand your prompts? The ability to understand prompts dramatically depends on the quality of embeddings. Let’s explore why. In this article we will discuss about Embeddings and Embedding. What are Embeddings? In simple terms, embeddings are vector representations in a vector space. Embeddings are not limited to words, they can be of other inputs like sentences, images, and graphs. Embeddings represent high-dimensional data like texts and images into vectors of low dimension. With this, the task of processing this complex data becomes easier for models that only understand continuous numbers. Vectors are the key here. In computer science, vectors are represented in an array where [a] is a 1-dimensional vector, [a, b] is 2-dimensional, and so on. From a mathematical view, vectors can be added, which applies to embeddings too. Just like adding vectors gives us other vectors, adding embeddings will provide another embedding. Types of Embeddings: Word Embeddings: Word embeddings are vector representations of words in a vector space where each words are given a vector. In the vector space, related words are close to each other. Let’s say if “man” is represented with [0.5, 5.5, -0.7]. Since man and woman are semantically similar words, “woman” would have a vector embedding similar to it. Also, hereby performing arithmetic operations on such vectors, we can attain similar vectors. E.g “king” - “man” + “woman” = “queen”. Some popular models for word embeddings are Word2vec, GloVe, and FastText. Sentence Embeddings: Sentence embeddings are vector representations of whole sentences. Unlike word embeddings, the whole sentence is mapped in a vector space, and semantically similar sentences are closer in the vector space. Models like InferSent, and Doc2vec(extension of Word2vec) are used to generate sentence embeddings. Image Embeddings: Images can also be transformed into vectors, that is exactly what you’ll call image embeddings. CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are best for generating image embeddings, which are later used for tasks like image classification and image retrieval. Audio and speech Embeddings: Audio and speech embeddings are generated by converting the raw audio and speech data into vectors that can be suitable for tasks like speech recognition and emotion detection. VGGish and Wav2vect are models dedicated to such embeddings. Why do we need Embeddings? The problem with raw, categorical, or high-dimensional data Before embeddings were ubiquitous, encoding techniques like one-hot encoding were used to represent categorical variables. However, this technique has limitations. Let’s say we have a small vocabulary of 5 words: “ Cat “, “ dog “, “ fish “, “ bird “, “ horse “ One-hot encoding works by generating a binary representation for each class where the position corresponding to the word is represented by 1. So we get a representation similar to the table below. Such representations are called sparse vectors, and these were the foundations for early word embedding techniques. So this works fine for a small number of classes, but what if we have all the words in the English language? How big will this table be? So big that the computation will be too high and messy. Not only that, while extracting the semantics out of words, the model will be confused. This problem is solved by embeddings, which are also called dense vectors. The embeddings not only numerically represent but are also able to capture the semantics of words by introducing a distance concept where words with similar semantics have a very small distance. For similarity measurements, cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and several others can be used. Real World Applications Embeddings have become foundational across NLP, recommendation systems, and computer vision. Their power lies in transforming raw, high-dimensional data into dense vectors that encode contextual, semantic, or behavioral relationships, enabling machines to reason more effectively about language, users, and visual content. Text Search: Embeddings are key for any retrieval tasks that involve retrieving similar documents based on a given query. Embeddings and embedding models are a crucial part of the RAG( Retrieval Augmented Generation) architecture, which is a great approach to prevent LLMs from hallucination. Recommendation system: In a recommendation system, whether it’s for movies, food, or clothes, embedding models are used to represent them in vectors. They are stored in a vector space and can be compared to recommend similar ones. Sentiment Analysis: Sentiments are very abstract for models to detect, but using embeddings and capturing sentiment-related features can ease the process. Positive words or sentences have similar embeddings, which can differentiate them from negative word embeddings. Evolution of Embedding Models From one-hot to word2vec: One-hot encoding was the most primitive way of representing words in a vector, where only the corresponding word was represented as one and others as zeros. This approach was succeeded by TF-IDF (Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency) in an attempt to capture the importance of words based on their frequency in a document(sentences or phrases) and across all the documents. Sparck Jones proposed it in his paper “A Statistical Interpretation of term specificity and its application in retrieval.” TF-IDF captured more useful information than one-hot encoding, but still could not capture the semantics. Word2vec was a revolutionary technique first proposed in a paper titled “Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space”. It was suggested by Tomas Mikolov and colleagues at Google and published in 2013. Similalry, it uses a shallow neural network to capture the linguistic context of words from a large corpus of text. It produces an embedding that maps words to a vector space, typically of a few hundred dimensions. Cosine Similarity is used to measure the similarity between the embeddings. Static Vs Contextual Embedding Models Models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText are effective at generating dense vector representations of words, known as embeddings, which capture semantic relationships. Word2Vec, in particular, learns these embeddings using one of two architectures: CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) or Skip-gram. However, the embeddings produced by these models are static, meaning each word has a single representation regardless of context. As a result, they struggle with polysemy-where a word has multiple meanings. For example, they cannot distinguish between the word bat in the sentences: “He bought a new bat to play cricket.” “Bat flies at night.” Contextual nuances are lost because the embedding is based solely on word co-occurrence statistics in a fixed window of text, rather than the full context of a sentence. In such scenarios, a contextualized model like BERT( Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) excels where word embeddings are generated based on the context of surrounding words. BERT’s bidirectionality allows it to look for context at both the left and right context of a word during training. So, the embeddings BERT produces are contextual, that is, words can have different embeddings based on their context. This makes it very powerful in generating robust embeddings that can retain contextualized semantics. Key Challenges and Limitations Embedding models is a game-changing concept, but it has ethical considerations. The models may learn the bias in the training data that can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in their applications. So, realizing and mitigating such bias becomes a crucial part of developing a safe and ethical AI system. Bias in Embeddings: Textual data that human produces are inherently biased. So, while training embedding models to learn the semantics and contexts, such bias gets slipped. A common example is associating “doctors” with males and “nurses” with females, reflecting societal stereotypes. These biases can lead to unfairness and discrimination in real-world applications like a recommendation system or a hiring system. To mitigate such biases, techniques like debiasing embeddings can be adapted, which remove or neutralize biased dimensions. Regular testing for bias and fairness while introducing diverse and representative training data is a must. Transparency and Accountability: Transparency and accountability are another aspect that needs to be considered while dealing with embedding models. The advanced embedding model represents data in dimensions that range in the hundreds, which is incomprehensible and affects the outcomes of AI systems. Hence, developers should focus on being transparent about training data and the choice of models. Conclusion Embedding models are the cornerstone of modern AI that allows powerful models to process high dimensional data which was previously impossible. The evolution of word embeddings from Word2Vect and GloVe to state-of-the-art models like BERT and GPT has enabled new possibilities in NLP, computer vision, and recommendation systems. As current models start to evolve and shape the world, it becomes inevitable to understand embedding models. Understanding their use cases equips us to build powerful AI systems that transform conventional tasks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a hot topic in the tech industry, with opinions ranging from it being a revolutionary boom to a potential doom. It has raised a big question: Artificial Intelligence dilemma, a shortcut or a Roadblock? AI has undeniably transformed the field of technology, significantly speeding up development processes. Before the advent of Artificial Intelligence(AI) tools, developing a full-stack web application could take over a month. Now, with clear requirements, it can be accomplished in less than a week. This acceleration is indeed fascinating, especially for senior developers who can leverage AI to enhance their productivity. However, the impact of AI on junior developers is a different story. While AI tools offer a quick path to creating sophisticated applications, they also pose a significant risk: over-reliance. Junior developers, who are just entering the tech field, may become too dependent on these tools, potentially hindering their long-term growth and understanding of fundamental concepts. The Artificial Intelligence Dilemma: Efficiency vs. Learning Imagine two developers, a junior and a senior tasked with building a full-stack e-commerce web application. The junior developer is allowed to use any AI tool, while the senior developer must rely solely on their technical skills, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and other resources. Initially, the junior developer’s application might appear more polished and feature-rich. However, the true test comes when both are asked to make small changes without the aid of AI tools. The junior developer, accustomed to AI assistance, might struggle to implement these changes efficiently and bug-free. In contrast, the senior developer, with a deep understanding of the fundamentals, can make the necessary adjustments smoothly. This scenario highlights a critical issue: Junior developers may be skipping essential learning steps by relying too heavily on AI tools. The Importance of Fundamentals One of the major problems observed in junior developers today is a lack of interest in learning the fundamentals. They often want to jump straight into advanced topics and tools without building a strong foundation. This approach can lead to a superficial understanding of technology, making it difficult to troubleshoot issues or adapt to new challenges without AI assistance. The Future of Software Development Despite the concerns, it’s unlikely that software developers or engineers will lose their jobs to AI. Instead, Artificial Intelligence will likely change the workflow, making processes more efficient. The role of a software engineer might evolve, but it won’t be replaced by AI entirely. The idea of “Software Engineer 2.0” being synonymous with “Machine Learning Engineer” is a misconception. The future will still require developers with a solid grasp of fundamentals, who can use AI tools as an enhancement rather than a crutch. Adapting to the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven workforce A recent study conducted by Pearson, in partnership with ServiceNow, provides an extensive analysis of the potential effects of AI and automation on the economies of six countries (U.S., UK, Germany, India, Australia, and Japan) and how technology-based roles are expected to evolve. Despite concern from potentially affected groups, this research shows that junior application developers will remain valuable even as AI continues to evolve. The study suggests that in the coming years, those junior developers who can understand and adapt to their new roles will be best prepared to thrive in the AI-driven workforce of the future. The rise of AI and automation significantly impacts the skills required for junior developers to succeed in the tech industry. By analyzing their workflows and identifying areas where automation can provide the most significant value, developers can implement automation tools and processes, freeing time for more complex work. Project-based learning is a popular and effective way for new developers to gain hands-on experience and apply their coding skills to real-world challenges. However, this approach also presents its own set of unique challenges. Many new developers encounter pitfalls, but mastering code quality can set them apart in a competitive industry. Conclusion AI tools offer tremendous potential for accelerating development and enhancing productivity. However, for junior developers, over-reliance on these tools can be a double-edged sword. While they provide a quick path to creating complex applications, they can also hinder the learning of essential fundamentals. The key is to strike a balance: use AI tools to augment your skills, but never at the expense of understanding the core principles of software development. By doing so, junior developers can grow into well-rounded, competent professionals capable of adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer Sci-Fi, it’s here, transforming industries, and AI in healthcare is one of the most promising yet complex domains it’s reshaping. From detecting cancer in medical scans to predicting strokes before they occur, AI has the potential to make healthcare faster, more efficient, and more precise. But alongside these advancements come technical hurdles, ethical dilemmas, and critical questions about how much control we should give to algorithms in life-and-death decisions. So, what does the future of AI in healthcare look like? Let’s explore. The Promise of AI in Healthcare AI in medicine is like having a supercharged doctor with a photographic memory and lightning-fast thinking. It’s already changing the game, spotting diseases like Alzheimer’s and breast cancer earlier and more accurately than ever. Hospitals are using AI to cut down ER wait times and manage resources better, while in drug discovery, breakthroughs like DeepMind’s AlphaFold are rewriting the rules of protein research. Imagine taking a pill crafted exclusively for you designed to target your condition with laser precision, minimize side effects, and accelerate recovery. That’s the promise of personalized medicine. At a biomedical hackathon at Kathmandu University, I got a deep dive into human genetics and discovered how genetic sequencing, protein interactions, and biomarker analysis could unlock this future. Of course, challenges like data privacy and algorithmic bias remain, but one thing is clear-AI is revolutionizing healthcare in the best way possible. Key Challenges in Implementation of AI in HealthCare With great power comes great responsibility-and AI in healthcare is the Spider-Man of modern medicine. It’s got all this dazzling potential, but sorry, folks, it’s not as easy as flicking an “on” switch and calling it a day. AI depends on vast amounts of high-quality data, but medical records are often scattered, incomplete, or trapped in outdated systems. When AI feeds on bad data, it produces unreliable predictions, leading to potential misdiagnoses and treatment errors. The challenge isn’t just collecting data but ensuring it is accurate, standardized, and accessible. Then there’s the cost challenge. Developing and implementing AI isn’t inexpensive-it takes a significant investment for hospitals to bring it on board. Smaller clinics and less-funded regions often can’t keep up, watching from the sidelines as larger institutions adopt the technology. This isn’t just unfortunate-it could deepen the gap in healthcare access, where advanced AI tools are mostly available to well-resourced facilities. Patient care shouldn’t feel exclusive, should it? Then there’s the issue of trust. Doctors aren’t always eager to embrace algorithms-they’ve spent years building their expertise through hands-on experience, not managing software. Many view AI with skepticism, unsure of its role in their practice. Without thorough training and clear evidence that AI supports rather than replaces their judgment, adoption will likely remain gradual. AI’s role in healthcare must be that of an assistant, not an authority-augmenting human expertise rather than attempting to replace it. The potential? Oh, it’s huge -AI could be the rockstar of healthcare. But if we don’t tackle these hiccups, it might just end up as another overhyped gadget gathering dust in the corner. Ethical Concerns Beyond technical and financial barriers, AI in healthcare raises serious ethical questions. Let’s ensure this revolution succeeds, time to address the challenges thoughtfully and focus on effective solutions! Privacy and Data Security AI requires access to extensive patient data to function effectively, but this poses risks. Medical records contain highly sensitive information-who controls access, and how can we ensure data remains secure? Patients deserve transparency and strict safeguards against breaches or misuse. Bias and Fairness AI systems learn from old data, and sometimes that data has a few sneaky flaws. If it shortchanges certain groups, the AI might not treat everyone fairly. Case in point: one fancy AI once underestimated Black patients’ needs because it was fed healthcare spending stats that weren’t quite balanced. Fixing these little hiccups is a must to keep AI healthcare fair for all. Accountability and Trust When AI makes a medical error, who is responsible-the doctor, the developer, or the algorithm itself? Unlike human professionals, AI cannot explain its reasoning in a way we always understand, making accountability difficult. Trust in AI requires transparency, rigorous testing, and the ability for healthcare providers to interpret and validate AI recommendations. NeuroVision: A Case Study in Responsible AI Development One project that highlights AI’s potential, when developed responsibly, is NeuroVision. This initiative uses AI to classify brain tumors from DICOM medical images, based on a proposed technical architecture that integrates deep learning models with cloud-based processing for improved speed and accuracy. The dataset for this system is developed using Functional APIs, which enable efficient handling and structuring of complex medical imaging data. If implemented with proper ethical considerations, it could significantly enhance early tumor detection, leading to faster diagnoses and improved treatment planning. However, for NeuroVision to succeed ethically, several factors must be addressed: Data Transparency & Security : Ensuring patient imaging data is handled with the highest standards of encryption and privacy protection. Bias Mitigation : Training the model on diverse datasets to avoid racial, gender, or socioeconomic disparities in diagnosis. Explainability : Implementing explainable AI (XAI) techniques to help radiologists understand why the AI reached a particular conclusion, rather than treating it as a “black box.” Collaboration with Medical Experts : Ensuring that NeuroVision remains a tool that assists radiologists rather than replaces them, maintaining human oversight in critical decisions. If developed with these ethical pillars in mind, NeuroVision could set an example for responsible AI integration in healthcare, proving that innovation and responsibility can go hand in hand. The Road Ahead: Balancing Innovation and Responsibility The future of AI in healthcare all comes down to finding that sweet spot. We need strong rules to make sure AI plays fair, owns up to its mistakes, and keeps our data safe. And let’s be real-transparency matters. If patients and doctors can’t figure out how AI comes up with its answers, they’re not going to trust it, plain and simple. The trick is teamwork. AI techies, doctors, ethicists, and policymakers have to join forces to build systems that aren’t just cutting-edge but also decent and focused on people. Think of it like a three-legged stool: you’ve got innovation, responsibility, and trust holding it up. Kick one out, and the whole thing comes crashing down. The good news? We’re already seeing some wins. A few hospitals are testing out AI that explains itself, governments are sketching out ethics rules, and researchers are digging into the messy stuff like bias and fairness. Still, we’ve got a ways to go-nobody said this would be a quick fix! Conclusion AI could shake up healthcare-think of quicker diagnoses, sharper treatments, and healthier vibes all around. But let’s not kid ourselves: tech isn’t some magic fix-it wand. It’s more like a trusty tool, and we’ve got to use it right. The point isn’t to swap out doctors for robots-it’s to give them a boost so they can help us better. So, here’s the big question: Can we make sure AI’s got humanity’s back without messing up on ethics, fairness, or trust? If cool projects like NeuroVision show us how to do AI the responsible way, I’d say we’ve got a solid shot at a “heck yes.” What’s your take where do we set the boundaries? AI is changing the world, from personalizing education to speeding up legal proceedings. Nepal is starting to have some serious conversations about how to bring AI into both classrooms and courtrooms. Sounds great, right? Smarter learning, fewer court delays, and even fewer “lost” files at government offices. But before we start imagining an AI-powered utopia, let’s take a step back and ask: Are we actually ready for this? AI in Education : Smarter Learning or Just Smarter Cheating? There’s no doubt that AI could make education better-adaptive learning, instant feedback, automated grading. No more teachers drowning in piles of homework, no more students struggling to keep up in one-size-fits-all lessons. Sounds perfect. Except... we all know what’s actually going to happen. The minute AI becomes a classroom staple, half the students will be using it to actually learn , while the other half will figure out how to get ChatGPT to do their homework while they scroll TikTok. Teachers, instead of grading essays, will be busy trying to figure out if a real student wrote that beautifully worded analysis on Shakespeare-or if it was just AI flexing its literary muscles. At a recent consultation on AI in education, officials, tech experts, and educators sat down to discuss what this all means for Nepal. Baikuntha Prasad Aryal from the Ministry of Education pointed out that we need to integrate AI into schools now if we don’t want to fall behind. But it’s not as simple as flipping a switch. Nepal has to make sure AI is being used to bridge gaps , not widen them. Because if we’re not careful, we’ll end up in a situation where fancy private schools have AI-powered tutors while public schools are still struggling with basic internet access. Michael Croft from UNESCO put it best-if we don’t have a clear plan, we’ll be left with chaos. And honestly, Nepal has enough of that already. AI in the Courts: A Fix for Legal Backlogs or a Future of Robot Judges? Over in the legal world, AI is being pitched as the ultimate analytical person. Nepal’s court system has been drowning in backlogged cases for years , so AI could be a game changer. Imagine an AI-powered system organizing case files, scheduling hearings, and sorting through mountains of paperwork in seconds. The dream! But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. While AI is great at analyzing data, the law isn’t about data. It’s about human judgment, cultural context, and sometimes, the ability of a judge to stare at a witness until they crack under the pressure. Can AI do that? Probably not. And then there’s the issue of bias. AI is only as good as the data it learns from. If we feed it outdated, biased legal precedents, it’s just going to spit out decisions that reinforce the same old problems. Also, let’s not forget-Nepal’s legal system deals with some wild cases. Imagine an AI judge trying to settle a property dispute over a sacred cow . Would it suggest a fair legal rule, or would it just start Googling “cow ownership laws” and crash from confusion? Data security is another big concern. Nepal’s courts handle a lot of sensitive information. If AI systems aren’t built with proper safeguards, we could be looking at some serious privacy issues. The last thing we need is a legal database getting hacked and people’s private case details ending up who-knows-where . So, What’s the Plan? AI isn’t here to replace teachers or judges here to assist them. In schools, AI should make learning more engaging and personalized, not turn students into expert-level AI users who never actually study . In courts, AI should help speed up the system, not take over decision-making. Because the last thing Nepal needs is a court ruling delayed because the AI judge needed a software update . If we do this right, AI could genuinely make Nepal’s education and legal systems faster, smarter, and fairer . But if we rush in without a plan, we could be looking at a future where students don’t actually learn, and AI judges accidentally hand out life sentences for traffic violations . The future is exciting-but only if we don’t let AI run wild. Inspired by: UNESCO’s consultation on AI in Nepal’s education system and how it could change learning experiences. Discussions from the Kathmandu Post on AI’s potential role in the judiciary while keeping human judgment at the center. The very real possibility of students using AI to “study” without actually learning anything. The even bigger possibility of AI judges completely misinterpreting Nepal’s very complex legal system. For thousands of years, humans have looked up at the night sky, searching for meaning, guidance, and understanding. Astronomy, the study of celestial objects and the universe , has played a crucial role in shaping human civilization. From ancient navigation to modern scientific breakthroughs, astronomy has expanded our knowledge and transformed our daily lives in profound ways. Yet, while the vastness of the universe might make us feel insignificant, it is through our relentless pursuit of knowledge that we find purpose in discovery and progress. Now, let us explore the importance of astronomy for humanity. 1. Advancing Science, Technology, and Data-Driven Innovation Astronomy has been a driving force behind technological advancements. Innovations developed for space exploration, such as satellite technology, have led to improvements in communication. Similalry it has also contributed in weather forecasting, and GPS navigation (NASA, 2022). Similarly, research in astrophysics has also contributed to breakthroughs in medicine, including MRI technology. It was influenced by the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance studied by astrophysicists. In the modern era, astronomy increasingly relies on data science and artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze vast amounts of cosmic data. AI-powered algorithms assist astronomers in identifying exoplanets, detecting patterns in galactic structures, and even predicting cosmic events. Machine learning models process terabytes of astronomical images, helping scientists uncover insights that would take decades through traditional methods. Additionally, the synergy between AI, data science, and astronomy continually pushes the boundaries of what humanity can achieve, turning what once seemed impossible into reality. 2. Understanding Our Place in the Universe with AI-Powered Discoveries The study of astronomy helps us answer fundamental questions about our origins and existence. Observing distant galaxies, black holes, and exoplanets broadens our perspective on the cosmos. In addition to this discoveries like the Big Bang Theory and the possibility of extraterrestrial life challenge our understanding of reality and fuel human curiosity. Today, AI and data science play an essential role in processing the immense amount of observational data collected by telescopes. Neural networks assist in classifying galaxies, while deep learning models analyze radio signals for potential extraterrestrial communication. The vastness of the universe may sometimes make us feel small, but the integration of AI in astronomy reminds us that human ingenuity allows us to decipher the cosmos like never before. The pursuit of cosmic knowledge affirms our desire to explore and understand, proving that even in an immense and mysterious universe, we have a meaningful role to play. 3. Protecting Earth from Cosmic Threats with Predictive Analytics Astronomy plays a key role in identifying and tracking potential dangers from space, such as asteroids and comets. Early detection systems allow scientists to develop potential strategies for planetary defense, ensuring the safety of future generations (NASA CNEOS, 2023). With the help of AI-driven predictive models, astronomers can now analyze the trajectory of near-Earth objects (NEOs) with unprecedented accuracy. Machine learning algorithms assess the likelihood of impact, providing early warnings and allowing for strategic intervention. In a universe where uncertainty abounds, our ability to monitor and prepare for these threats is a testament to human ingenuity, resilience, and the power of data-driven science. 4. Inspiring Future Generations in AI, Data Science, and Space Exploration The wonder of astronomy has inspired countless individuals to pursue careers in science, engineering, and space exploration. Figures like Carl Sagan, Katherine Johnson, and Neil deGrasse Tyson have ignited curiosity and passion for the cosmos in millions. Programs like NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and SpaceX have sparked public interest and motivated young minds to dream of interstellar travel and space colonization. In recent years, the rise of AI and data science in astronomy has created new career paths at the intersection of space and technology. Aspiring scientists and engineers now have the opportunity to develop machine learning models for space exploration, create algorithms to analyze deep-space images, and contribute to cutting-edge AI-driven research. By looking to the stars, we not only dream of space travel but also advance the tools and knowledge. 5. Uniting Humanity Through AI-Driven Exploration Astronomy is a truly global science that transcends borders, cultures, and politics. International collaborations like the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) bring together scientists from around the world to explore the universe (ESA, 2023). Likewise these joint efforts highlight the power of cooperation in achieving groundbreaking discoveries. AI is playing an increasing role in these international projects, enabling automated data processing, optimizing telescope observations, and facilitating large-scale collaborations. From AI-enhanced simulations of galaxy formation to deep-learning-driven space probes, technology is bridging the gap between human curiosity and the vast cosmos. When humanity works together-combining astronomy, AI, and data science-we affirm that our collective future is one of unity, curiosity, and shared progress. Conclusion Therefore, Astronomy is more than just an academic pursuit-it is a gateway to innovation. Also, it is a means of understanding our place in the cosmos, and a unifying force for humanity. Though the vastness of space may sometimes make us feel small, our continued exploration reaffirms our significance. Today, AI and data science are revolutionizing how we explore the universe, transforming petabytes of astronomical data into groundbreaking discoveries. By seeking answers, pushing boundaries, and striving for knowledge, we turn feelings of futility into a profound appreciation for the endless possibilities that lie ahead. Also, the universe remains our greatest frontier, and our journey into its mysteries-driven by both human curiosity and artificial intelligence-has only just begun.

In the past, handling these documents required a lot of work, time, and human error. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, on the other hand, has transformed document processing by making it possible for machines to accurately read and digitize handwritten or printed text. Applications for OCR have been found in several industries, including banking, healthcare, law firms, education, and government organizations. These applications have greatly increased accessibility, decreased costs, and improved efficiency. This blog examines the main advantages, difficulties, and prospects of OCR as it transforms document processing. What is OCR? A method called optical character recognition (OCR) turns many document formats including scanned paper documents, PDFs, and digital device photos into machine-readable text. Even for handwritten and stylized fonts, advanced OCR systems improve text recognition accuracy by utilizing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). OCR technology works in three key steps: Image Preprocessing - Enhancing the quality of scanned documents by removing noise, skew correction, and adjusting brightness.

Conclusion OCR technology is revolutionizing document processing across industries, automating workflows, reducing errors, and improving data accessibility. Similarly, as Nepal embraces digital transformation, OCR adoption will be crucial for businesses and government agencies looking to enhance efficiency and security. With AI and ML advancements, OCR is becoming smarter and more reliable, offering multilingual support, real-time processing, and better accuracy. Organizations investing in OCR will not only improve document management but also stay ahead in the digital era. Hence, as Nepal continues to digitize, OCR will play a crucial role in shaping the future of data processing, making information more accessible, secure, and efficient. Blogs As we are getting more technology exposure here in Nepal, a lot of new methods and changes have been seen in multiple. But not quite much in the banking sector. As smartphones are now available almost all over the country, it is no surprise that Artificial Intelligence is also starting to pop here. However, like technology, Nepal’s banking sector has been slower compared to other sectors. Banks in Nepal, while modernizing and adopting new techniques, are still hesitant to fully accept AI. This is mainly due to the terms of infrastructure regulation, and trust. But as Nepal’s financial services sector continues to evolve, AI offers multiple services: personalized services and many more. It also offers smarter risk management and more secure transaction processes. So let’s see and explore why the banking sector is slow in this trend. Similarly, let’s explore what opportunity this technology holds, and how we can benefit from this system. The Challenge of AI Adoption in Nepal’s Banking Sector Regulatory and Compliance Concerns Nepal’s banking system operates under a strict regulatory framework. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank of Nepal, closely monitors financial institutions. Additionally, it ensures the safety and security of customer deposits and financial systems. While there are regulations regarding AI being adopted globally at a slow pace, Nepal’s banking sector is particularly cautious. This is due to the lack of clear guidelines on how to implement AI technologies within the confines of its regulatory environment. For instance, the NRB’s existing regulation, which focuses mainly on traditional banking methods, might not fully be compatible with the data-driven nature of AI. With AI systems relying heavily on data, including sensitive customer information, its compliance with NEpal’s privacy act and others becomes even more complex. Therefore there is a rooted hesitation in implementing AI solutions as the main concern is data security and regulatory oversight. 1. Data Security and Privacy As said, Data Security remains a concerning topic and a top priority for Banks. As AI requires large datasets to function effectively, the risk of security breaches and data misuse is a growing concern. It is also to be noted that Nepal’s Banking system is often targeted by cybercriminals and this kind of news on people’s data being breached or leaked is common. To reduce this an AI should have a secure system to mitigate threats like fraud, hacking, and identity theft. In Nepal where the digital payment system is just a new innovative step compared to other countries who have already introduced this system years ago and yet still begot one or two problems in the well-established payment system we use today. Now, introducing AI to this field and trusting that AI’s ability to keep personal and financial data is very hard. To do this we will require time and a lot of data to train the model. Additionally meeting the demand of both customers and regulators in the process is also important. 2. Infrastructure and Legacy Systems Many banks in Nepal still operate on legacy traditional systems. The systems are not designed to integrate with the advanced features of AI. Unlike other countries where banks have new cutting-edge technology, Nepali financial institutions often operate on older core banking systems. The cost and risk of upgrading this system can be problematic, especially for smaller or regional banks. Additionally, the high quantity data for training ML models, is a hectic process here as majority of data collection , storage and sharing are oftenfragmented which creates another roadblock for Ai-driven solution. As a result, banks are very serious and cautious in the approach of Ai integration and monthly reluctant to overhaul the existing system that they are comfortable with. 3. Skill Gap AI itself is a new concept introduced in Nepal. The skills required to develop and manage AI are thus limited here. While there has been growth in the tech industry, the specialized knowledge needed to operate AI-driven tools. But in the banking sector or any other sector, such tools are quite limited. Data Scientists, machine learning engineers, and Ai specialists are in high demand globally, and Nepal’s banking sector faces the same shortage of talents. The Opportunities of AI in Nepal’s Banking Sector Despite these challenges, the potential for Ai in Nepal’s banking sector is huge, and here is how Ai can make a difference: 1. Personalized Banking Services The Nepalese banking sector focuses on customer service enhancement as mobile banking services expand their reach to residents of urban and rural Nepal. The implementation of AI enables Nepali banks to deliver customized products that specifically address the personal requirements of their individual customers. AI-powered chatbots provide round-the-clock customer support facilities that handle inquiries and transactions alongside personalized financial recommendations based on user spending behavior. The increase in Nepali consumers choosing mobile and digital banking platforms will drive escalated requirements for personalized banking services across the industry. AI systems examine financial records in combination with payment behaviors and societal indicators to customize financial services that let users improve their money management strategies. 2. Fraud Detection and Prevention The growth of digital banking across Nepal has produced intensified banking fraud cases affecting the industry. Artificial intelligence functions as a reliable instrument to both find and halt fraudulent behavior. AI leverages real-time transaction analysis through machine learning algorithms to spot unexpected spending activities which then allows it to notify bank customers or the institution before major financial losses occur. AI technology assists Nepali banks to discover credit card abuse together with money laundering and identity theft leading to enhanced cybersecurity protection. The implementation of AI would deliver necessary security measures when Nepali banks plan to expand their digital services. 3. Operational Efficiency Bank institutions throughout Nepal together with international financial institutions seek continuous methods to minimize operational costs and enhance operational efficiency. The implementation of AI solutions enables banks to execute repetitive duties like data recording together with loan analysis while running credit ratings besides checking against industry regulations. The implementation of AI leads banks to achieve better operational efficiency with reduced costs. The Nepalese banking system which maintains mostly manual and paper-intensive services can experience rapid progress thanks to AI applications. Benefits from this approach would improve the customer journey while simultaneously lowering both operational expenses and human-related service shortcomings. Conclusion The banking sector in Nepal is approaching an era of artificial intelligence transformation. The banking sector of Nepal faces ongoing challenges linked to regulatory checkpoints and limited infrastructure. In addition to the shortage of capable personnel but the promise of AI to enhance customer service and operations exists in direct proportion to its capacity to boost security measures. Future improvements in Nepal’s digital environment will make artificial intelligence essential for banking organizations. It will make us want to stay competitive while serving customers who use technology. The banking sector in Nepal will adapt AI capabilities at a moderate pace given that future prospects appear positive. If Nepal’s financial institutions establish plans, gain regulatory certainty and prioritize data security then they can use AI to develop an efficient banking system that is centered on customer needs and secured operations. Introduction Optical character recognition is the key to document process automation in today’s digital world, as it allows machines to read printed and handwritten texts. Although OCR has made significant progress in some major languages such as English, Chinese, and Spanish, it remains a great challenge to low-resource languages, which do not have a digital dataset of their own and NLP resources. This article will discover how recent AI and deep learning advancements are revolutionizing low-resource language OCR for low-resource languages. Its implementation in low-resource languages has remained only a dream until the recent advancement and breakthrough in AI and deep learning. This is going to bring a new possibility for OCR with low-resource languages, which may revolutionize the sectors of government documentation, historical text digitization, and financial automation in regions of these languages, and hence large-prevailing areas, among others. He then proceeds to explain the challenges of OCR in low-resource languages, elaborating on the very recent advancement in AI-driven OCR and how it is impacting automation across different industries. Understanding Low-Resource Languages in OCR What Are Low-Resource Languages? Low-resourced languages are those languages that normally lack large-scale annotated data, clean and robust linguistic resources (such as dictionaries and corpora), labeled training data, and, more than anything, powerful and well-supported research in computational linguistics. Some of the most famous examples are Nepali, Sinhala, and Amharic; in general, local, indigenous languages that do not have large communities developed around them. While languages such as English or Chinese have billions of texts available in digital form, such languages often suffer from a lack of labeled text data to train an OCR system. OCR and Its Role in Automation OCR is the technology to convert the hard-copy or scanned text into a machine-readable format. It’s applied in wide areas such as: Document digitization (scanning books, archives, historical records) Automated processing of invoices and receipts (financial automation) Automatic data entry in government and enterprise workflows Assistive support technologies like reading tools for the visually impaired OCR systems include Google Tesseract for high-resource languages, ABBYY FineReader, Amazon Textract, and several others. OCR systems like Google Tesseract work very well for high-resource languages. Still, for low-resource languages, the efficiency of the tools described above depends primarily on the data available and is therefore often associated with low accuracy because there is a scarcity of this data, combined with complex scripts and various handwriting styles. Challenges in OCR for Low-Resource Languages Lack of High-Quality Training Data OCR models inherently require thousands to millions of labeled text image pairs for effective training. In most low-resource languages, there is already a lack of digitized books, newspapers, etc., which further hampers training a good OCR model. Texts from books and newspapers available in low-resource languages are mostly turn of the century with highly deteriorated quality. It is, therefore, a big problem for the straightening and orderly OCR training model. Complex and Unique Scripts Written low-resource languages are generally non-Latin scripts, which pose a big challenge to any OCR engine. This might be associated with: Devanagari script (used in Nepali, Hindi, and Marathi) with character formations that are very tough Ethiopic script found in Amharic, which has many unique glyphs Also, Brahmic scripts are associated with ligatures and stacked letters. The traditional OCR models fail to yield good results on these scripts, especially when it comes to recognizing handwritten text. Poorly Scanned, Noisy Data Most of the documents written in low-resource languages have been scanned from deteriorated, old, and dirty sources and could have ink smudges, faded text, torn pages, or mixed text of different languages within the same document. Some of them may not have uniform font or space, which will make the OCR system much less accurate compared to those in high-resource languages. Lack of NLP Support for Post-Processing OCR is sometimes dependent on the NLP models, which help in better output correction for spell and grammar checking, etc. Since low-resourced languages suffer from the problem of missing pre-trained NLP models, OCR systems often fail to correct errors in the extracted text effectively. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning: The New Wave in OCR Automation The use of deep learning research in OCR models supported by artificial intelligence has been engaged in automating text extraction in under-resourced languages. This is one of the main methods they achieve this. Self-Supervised and Few-Shot Learning Instead of having to depend on huge labeled datasets, the AI models are now learning by being: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-The models learn from unlabelled data in large corpora at the input level like raw text or images. Few-Shot Learning-is to learn patterns based on very small data points, of course, instrumental for rare languages, an example of it being Facebook’s SeamlessM4T model using self-supervised learning to enhance multilingual text recognition - even in languages with less data. Advanced techniques - Transformer-Based OCR Models In the earlier days, OCRs used to be either rule-based or statistical. The modern OCR engines now have transformer models like Tesseract 5.0, TrOCR (pre-trains on high-resource languages and fine-tunes for low-resource languages) from Microsoft, and PaddleOCR (allows users to train custom models for rare scripts). Data Augmentation Techniques Some data augmentation strategies applied by the researchers due to limited labeled datasets include: GANs for generating synthetic data of text images in low-resource languages Rotating, distorting, or blurring text images in the training data to enhance the robustness of OCR. Example: Working on the Sanskrit OCR Project at Google involved extensive work to fix character recognition in ancient manuscripts, for which synthetic text generation had to be used. Cloud OCR Approaches and Edge OCR Enterprises are implementing OCR engines with cloud and mobile edge-computing solutions to enable more universally accessible OCR. Cloud-based OCR services-Google Vision API, and Microsoft Azure OCR-have added support for more low-resource languages. Edge computing enables OCR models on low-power devices, such as smartphones, to automate at scale Ways to Automate OCR in Low-Resource Languages Since AI-OCR is getting strengthened, there are a few significant ways in which OCR can drive automation: In the Federal and Public Administration: Decision-making statement automation for the process of paper-based documents for office work Birth certificates, records of land, and legal forms got scanned to keep in digital format Facilitated automatic document verification to assess citizens in remote areas. In Finance and Banking OCR can process invoices in cheques and in any local language. Digitization of receipts and tax documents for small businesses Preservation of Historical and Cultural OCR proves helpful for scanning old manuscripts and digitizing them; therefore, they can be preserved. OCR helps preserve old texts and manuscripts by conversion to a digital format, thus preserving endangered languages and cultures. AI Assistants and Chatbots OCR can extract the content of documents to power assistant-driven AI. Translate handwritten content into any language The Future of OCR in Low-Resource Languages It has been noted that AI and deep learning have opened up new possibilities for OCR in low-resource languages where automation was not so easy. While the challenges stay-limited datasets, script complexity, and noisy input-new techniques are coming up to improve the accuracy of the procedure. As OCR for low-resource languages gets more reliable, this will allow for the automation of government services, financial processing, cultural preservation, and educational fields. It is this technology that is going to bridge the digital gap by relaying all languages, no matter how rare they are, into beneficiaries of the power of AI-driven automation. This technology is going to be the start of a brand new future where all languages, no matter how rare, are going to benefit from the power of AI-driven automation. The future of OCR is not only with reading text but with digitalizing every language. At the moment cyber-attacks along with data breaches are growing more and more sophisticated by the day. The search for new ways of protecting our very own personal data has never been more critical. Cue biometric authentication new technology is a game-changer in the cyber security field. Spanning from fingerprinting to face scanning and iris scanning, biometric security solutions present a more secure and more convenient alternative. It is replacing and working as an alternative of passwords and PINs. However, as with any emerging tech, the use of biometrics raises serious privacy issues. Additionally, it also raised ethical questions regarding the overall use of biometrics. The Era of Biometric Security (Biometric Authentication) Biometrics is the act of recording our unique physical characteristics. Additionally, it might be a fingerprint, the contours of our face. It also may be the hue of the iris, for instance, we can use it as a form of identification. It is pilfered or lost. Biometrics is an authentication that physically ties to the biology of a human person. Biometric authentication is hard to duplicate. Facial recognition has been so popular because it is easy to use and easy to implement on daily devices. Phones, laptops, and even residential security systems use facial recognition to provide access. Today, it is also an easy and convenient method for consumers to unlock devices. Similarly, fingerprint readers, now ubiquitous on smartphones, are integrated into larger platforms. This will offer a secure and convenient method of verification. Similarly, for even more forward thinkers, there is iris scan technology. The technology provides yet another layer of security, imaging the patterns unique to the eye’s iris to verify identities. These technologies are widely viewed as a possible answer to the long-standing issue of password management. As cyber-attacks become more advanced password files get compromised daily. This leads users to find it difficult to practice good security hygiene. With biometrics, users should not remember complex combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols-they only need to be themselves. The Promise of Biometrics for Online Security The biggest advantage of biometric authentication is being able to create an even higher level of security. Passwords are either weak, used on more than one website, or just plain guessed easily. People use simple phrases or information easily found on the web. Biometrics are much more difficult to replicate. Even if the hacker manages to get your password or PIN, they would require your unique biological characteristics to breach the system. Furthermore, biometric systems are fast and convenient. Opening one’s phone with a quick scan of the individual’s fingerprint or glancing at one’s phone for facial scanning is normal. This kind of convenience can come with the ability to remove a significant amount of friction from users, allowing them to safely log in to online services without having to recall passwords or undergo multiple-step authentication processes. Furthermore, biometric systems can be multi-factor in nature. For instance, a device can require both a fingerprint and a face scan, which adds a layer of protection that isn’t possible with passwords. Since online threats are not demonstrating any indication of decelerating, layered security in the form of biometrics could prove to be one of the most robust protections on hand to combat cybercrime. Privacy Concerns: The Dark Side of Biometric Data For all their potential benefits, biometric systems aren’t without some very legitimate concerns of all of which are those having to do with privacy. Biometric authentication captures and stores a person’s own biological data by its very nature. Unlike a password, which we can change if someone compromises it, we cannot change our fingerprint, face, or iris. Because they are fixed and permanent. If hackers steal or someone mismanages that data, the consequences can be much worse One of the greatest risks is centralized biometric storage. When we login with biometrics, the information is kept on a server or in the cloud. When these databases are compromised by the attackers, they will not just obtain usernames and passwords but also very personal and irreversible data. Unwanted access to this kind of sensitive data could lead to identity theft, fraud, or blackmail. Another concern is the use of surveillance. Facial recognition software has been specifically aimed at application in public areas where people are unaware of being photographed. Governments and non-governmental agencies are using the systems to monitor individuals’ movements, activities, and even political affiliations. Though proponents have argued that it can be used in ways that might make us safer (e.g., to arrest criminals or deter terrorist attacks), others view it as an insidious threat to privacy and a tool for totalitarian oppression. In addition, their accuracy is an issue as well. They can have false positives and false negatives, thus giving unauthorized individuals access or not giving authorized individuals access. The study has determined that facial recognition software, for instance, has been found to operate at a higher rate of errors in identifying females and minorities, bringing about issues regarding the fairness and reliability of these technologies. Balancing Security and Privacy As with any technology progress, the issue with turning biometric authentication into a success is achieving the correct balance between security and privacy. To prevent such systems from being an evil empire, there must be strict regulation and protection mechanisms. Biometric information is encrypted and protected, and people should be in a position to delete or revoke access to their information at their discretion. Transparency about collection and usage of the biometric information will be most important to win consumers’ trust. The second important step is to design biometric systems that are equitable. The developers need to remove biases in facial recognition and other biometric systems so that they function as equally effectively with all populations of people. This will prevent discrimination. similarly, it also makes the population discriminatorily untargeted or excluded by the system. Last, users must be cognizant and careful of the technologies used. With any authentication method, it is intelligent to be knowledgeable of the risks and take measures to protect personal data. Whether activating multi-factor authentication, using encrypted apps, or selecting services with better privacy settings, users have to do something when it pertains to their cyber security. Conclusion: The Future of Biometric Authentication Biometric authentication is quite possibly the key to the cyber security revolution, with newer, quicker, safer methods of access to our data. Going forward, as technology will undoubtedly continue to improve, even new methods of authentication will emerge, such as voice or even DNA scanning. With all of the innovation, however, we need to be careful not to miss the privacy risk. Finally, the future of biometric security will be in our own hands, as we decide to balance the delicate trade-off between convenience, security, and privacy. With regulatory control, ethical innovation, and transparency as a priority, biometric authentication could well be the answer to a safer online existence. But with every innovation, we must move cautiously lest we mortgage privacy on the altar of convenience in a way we would later regret. Over the past ten years, Rust grew from an experimental project to one of the globe’s best-loved programming languages. Stack Overflow polls have demonstrated its popularity among programmers every year. It has consistently ranked as the ‘most loved’ language for several consecutive years. But are programmers truly so in love with this language? Why do engineers-from amateurs to industrial-scale professionals-keep choosing this language? Especially when so many others are competing in the same space?Today’s blog will delve into what makes this language so popular, its standout features, and how it has been able to etch itself a distinctive niche in contemporary software development. A Brief History Rust was a side project from Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare in 2006. A developer started Rust as a side project, and Mozilla gained enough interest in it to formally sponsor it The goal was to create a language that was highly performing with high safety guarantees, especially in regard to memory safety. After years of development, developers finally launched Rust 1.0 in 2015. Since then, various companies and communities have used it to achieve reliability without sacrificing speed. Why Developers are Loving It 1. Memory Safety Without a Garbage Collector One of the main attractions of Rust is that it has built a novel and fresh method for addressing memory. Whereas with C and C++ the memory is assigned and reclaimed manually by the developer, or in Java and Python it relies on garbage collection, Rust makes use of the model of ownership. With this system, memory is both effectively and safely managed at compile time, removing classes of typical bugs like null pointer dereferences, use-after-free, and data races. By enforcing borrowing and ownership rules strictly, Rust eliminates an entire class of bugs that are notoriously difficult to debug in other languages. That means fewer segmentation faults and no time wasted hunting for memory leaks. 2. Performance Comparable to C and C++ Rust is a compiled language that produces very optimized machine code and is near to C and C++ performance. As speedy as it is, it’s a top contender for system programming, game development, and other performance-critical applications. In contrast to garbage collection-halting languages, Rust provides deterministic runtime behavior and is therefore an ideal candidate for latency-critical applications. 3. Fearless Concurrency Concurrency is likely the most challenging area of contemporary software development. Rust’s ownership model extends to concurrency programming, where data races are detected at compile-time instead of leading to undefined behavior at runtime. The language enables one to use high-level abstractions like threads, async programming, and message-passing concurrency safely. 4. Developer-Friendly Tooling Rust’s ecosystem has a wealth of top-quality tools to enhance development. Cargo: Rust’s build system and dependency manager enable simple dependency management and compilation. Clippy: A built-in linting feature that catches common errors. Rustfmt: Helps enforce consistent code appearance across teams. Documentation Generation: Rust’s built-in documentation system makes it easy to generate well-structured docs directly from code comments. These tools assist in giving a more complete developer experience, so Rust is not just able but also enjoyable to work with. 5. Strong and Supportive Community The Rust community is famous for being friendly and helpful. The official Rust forums, Discord channels, and Reddit discussions are occupied by programmers who willingly share their knowledge. The programming language also enjoys a strong mentorship program and well-written documentation, making it easier to learn for newcomers. A Language Designed for Modern Development Rust was created with issues of modern software development in mind. Whether web assembly, embedded systems, or cloud-native applications, Rust has facets that appeal well to the demands of the day. With corporations such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google researching Rust for some of their projects, it’s clear that language will be part of future software development. Where It Is Being Used Web Development While Rust is not a traditional web development language, libraries like Rocket and Actix-web allow developers to build high-performance, secure web applications. Rust’s performance and safety make it an excellent backend language, especially when handling high-concurrency workloads. Embedded Systems Because of its low-level control and safety guarantees, Rust is becoming a popular choice for embedded programming. Companies working on firmware, IoT, and real-time operating systems are adopting Rust for its reliability and performance. Game Development Programmers need a language that combines speed with security. Rust offers both of them, along with libraries like Bevy and Amethyst that provide game development functionality similar to Unity or Unreal Engine. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Rust has been adopted by the likes of Solana and Polkadot because it is safe, fast, and can handle difficult concurrent operations. The correctness focus that the language is designed on also renders it a suitable choice for blockchain development whose security is of paramount importance. Operating Systems and Systems Programming Rust is also gaining popularity in systems programming. There even exist full-fledged operating systems written in Rust, such as the Redox OS. Microsoft even went far enough to experiment with re-compiling some elements of Windows with Rust for reasons of security and stability. Challenges of Learning Rust Despite its advantages, Rust is not without a learning curve. Developers who come from languages like Python or JavaScript do indeed struggle with Rust’s strict compiler rules and ownership model at first. Yet, once mastered, developers appreciate the power these give to code quality and security. Another difficulty is that Rust’s ecosystem while growing, is not yet as mature as more established languages such as Python or Java. Some libraries may not have the same level of documentation or support, but this is rapidly evolving as the language is used by more individuals. Is Rust the Future of Programming? Rust’s continuing development and adoption across use cases in various industries shows that Rust will reign over programming in the coming years. Its prowess at delivering safety without infringing on performance presents Rust as an excellent opportunity as a current form of software programming. As more companies tap into the positive aspect of applying Rust, the greater the chances are that future years will hold more extensive uses of it. If you’re a programmer looking to increase the value of your skills and safeguard your future career, studying Rust can be one of the best things you can do. Whether you’re building web apps, embedded systems, or high-performance software, Rust offers a mix of safety, performance, and programmer-centric features that few languages can equal. Final Thoughts Rust has turned into a force of revolution in the programming world. With its performance-focused and safe nature, supported by an open and growing community, it is a language with gigantic potential. Its rather steep learning curve aside, its long-term benefit in terms of code stability, concurrency safety, and system performance is gigantic. As companies continue to look out for solutions that are both scalable and secure, Rust’s value is going to grow steadily. Overall, Rust is not just a trend but also shows a larger shift towards the way applications are built nowadays. Its philosophy and its elements match quite well with the changing business and developer priorities, and as such, it is something that has to be seriously considered in the coming years. You recently started your AI journey and keep hearing terms like embeddings and encoding. These concepts are way more critical than you think. For instance, do you know LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek play with embeddings to understand your prompts? The ability to understand prompts dramatically depends on the quality of embeddings. Let’s explore why. In this article we will discuss about Embeddings and Embedding. What are Embeddings? In simple terms, embeddings are vector representations in a vector space. Embeddings are not limited to words, they can be of other inputs like sentences, images, and graphs. Embeddings represent high-dimensional data like texts and images into vectors of low dimension. With this, the task of processing this complex data becomes easier for models that only understand continuous numbers. Vectors are the key here. In computer science, vectors are represented in an array where [a] is a 1-dimensional vector, [a, b] is 2-dimensional, and so on. From a mathematical view, vectors can be added, which applies to embeddings too. Just like adding vectors gives us other vectors, adding embeddings will provide another embedding. Types of Embeddings: Word Embeddings: Word embeddings are vector representations of words in a vector space where each words are given a vector. In the vector space, related words are close to each other. Let’s say if “man” is represented with [0.5, 5.5, -0.7]. Since man and woman are semantically similar words, “woman” would have a vector embedding similar to it. Also, hereby performing arithmetic operations on such vectors, we can attain similar vectors. E.g “king” - “man” + “woman” = “queen”. Some popular models for word embeddings are Word2vec, GloVe, and FastText. Sentence Embeddings: Sentence embeddings are vector representations of whole sentences. Unlike word embeddings, the whole sentence is mapped in a vector space, and semantically similar sentences are closer in the vector space. Models like InferSent, and Doc2vec(extension of Word2vec) are used to generate sentence embeddings. Image Embeddings: Images can also be transformed into vectors, that is exactly what you’ll call image embeddings. CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are best for generating image embeddings, which are later used for tasks like image classification and image retrieval. Audio and speech Embeddings: Audio and speech embeddings are generated by converting the raw audio and speech data into vectors that can be suitable for tasks like speech recognition and emotion detection. VGGish and Wav2vect are models dedicated to such embeddings. Why do we need Embeddings? The problem with raw, categorical, or high-dimensional data Before embeddings were ubiquitous, encoding techniques like one-hot encoding were used to represent categorical variables. However, this technique has limitations. Let’s say we have a small vocabulary of 5 words: “ Cat “, “ dog “, “ fish “, “ bird “, “ horse “ One-hot encoding works by generating a binary representation for each class where the position corresponding to the word is represented by 1. So we get a representation similar to the table below. Such representations are called sparse vectors, and these were the foundations for early word embedding techniques. So this works fine for a small number of classes, but what if we have all the words in the English language? How big will this table be? So big that the computation will be too high and messy. Not only that, while extracting the semantics out of words, the model will be confused. This problem is solved by embeddings, which are also called dense vectors. The embeddings not only numerically represent but are also able to capture the semantics of words by introducing a distance concept where words with similar semantics have a very small distance. For similarity measurements, cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and several others can be used. Real World Applications Embeddings have become foundational across NLP, recommendation systems, and computer vision. Their power lies in transforming raw, high-dimensional data into dense vectors that encode contextual, semantic, or behavioral relationships, enabling machines to reason more effectively about language, users, and visual content. Text Search: Embeddings are key for any retrieval tasks that involve retrieving similar documents based on a given query. Embeddings and embedding models are a crucial part of the RAG( Retrieval Augmented Generation) architecture, which is a great approach to prevent LLMs from hallucination. Recommendation system: In a recommendation system, whether it’s for movies, food, or clothes, embedding models are used to represent them in vectors. They are stored in a vector space and can be compared to recommend similar ones. Sentiment Analysis: Sentiments are very abstract for models to detect, but using embeddings and capturing sentiment-related features can ease the process. Positive words or sentences have similar embeddings, which can differentiate them from negative word embeddings. Evolution of Embedding Models From one-hot to word2vec: One-hot encoding was the most primitive way of representing words in a vector, where only the corresponding word was represented as one and others as zeros. This approach was succeeded by TF-IDF (Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency) in an attempt to capture the importance of words based on their frequency in a document(sentences or phrases) and across all the documents. Sparck Jones proposed it in his paper “A Statistical Interpretation of term specificity and its application in retrieval.” TF-IDF captured more useful information than one-hot encoding, but still could not capture the semantics. Word2vec was a revolutionary technique first proposed in a paper titled “Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space”. It was suggested by Tomas Mikolov and colleagues at Google and published in 2013. Similalry, it uses a shallow neural network to capture the linguistic context of words from a large corpus of text. It produces an embedding that maps words to a vector space, typically of a few hundred dimensions. Cosine Similarity is used to measure the similarity between the embeddings. Static Vs Contextual Embedding Models Models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText are effective at generating dense vector representations of words, known as embeddings, which capture semantic relationships. Word2Vec, in particular, learns these embeddings using one of two architectures: CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) or Skip-gram. However, the embeddings produced by these models are static, meaning each word has a single representation regardless of context. As a result, they struggle with polysemy-where a word has multiple meanings. For example, they cannot distinguish between the word bat in the sentences: “He bought a new bat to play cricket.” “Bat flies at night.” Contextual nuances are lost because the embedding is based solely on word co-occurrence statistics in a fixed window of text, rather than the full context of a sentence. In such scenarios, a contextualized model like BERT( Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) excels where word embeddings are generated based on the context of surrounding words. BERT’s bidirectionality allows it to look for context at both the left and right context of a word during training. So, the embeddings BERT produces are contextual, that is, words can have different embeddings based on their context. This makes it very powerful in generating robust embeddings that can retain contextualized semantics. Key Challenges and Limitations Embedding models is a game-changing concept, but it has ethical considerations. The models may learn the bias in the training data that can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in their applications. So, realizing and mitigating such bias becomes a crucial part of developing a safe and ethical AI system. Bias in Embeddings: Textual data that human produces are inherently biased. So, while training embedding models to learn the semantics and contexts, such bias gets slipped. A common example is associating “doctors” with males and “nurses” with females, reflecting societal stereotypes. These biases can lead to unfairness and discrimination in real-world applications like a recommendation system or a hiring system. To mitigate such biases, techniques like debiasing embeddings can be adapted, which remove or neutralize biased dimensions. Regular testing for bias and fairness while introducing diverse and representative training data is a must. Transparency and Accountability: Transparency and accountability are another aspect that needs to be considered while dealing with embedding models. The advanced embedding model represents data in dimensions that range in the hundreds, which is incomprehensible and affects the outcomes of AI systems. Hence, developers should focus on being transparent about training data and the choice of models. Conclusion Embedding models are the cornerstone of modern AI that allows powerful models to process high dimensional data which was previously impossible. The evolution of word embeddings from Word2Vect and GloVe to state-of-the-art models like BERT and GPT has enabled new possibilities in NLP, computer vision, and recommendation systems. As current models start to evolve and shape the world, it becomes inevitable to understand embedding models. Understanding their use cases equips us to build powerful AI systems that transform conventional tasks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a hot topic in the tech industry, with opinions ranging from it being a revolutionary boom to a potential doom. It has raised a big question: Artificial Intelligence dilemma, a shortcut or a Roadblock? AI has undeniably transformed the field of technology, significantly speeding up development processes. Before the advent of Artificial Intelligence(AI) tools, developing a full-stack web application could take over a month. Now, with clear requirements, it can be accomplished in less than a week. This acceleration is indeed fascinating, especially for senior developers who can leverage AI to enhance their productivity. However, the impact of AI on junior developers is a different story. While AI tools offer a quick path to creating sophisticated applications, they also pose a significant risk: over-reliance. Junior developers, who are just entering the tech field, may become too dependent on these tools, potentially hindering their long-term growth and understanding of fundamental concepts. The Artificial Intelligence Dilemma: Efficiency vs. Learning Imagine two developers, a junior and a senior tasked with building a full-stack e-commerce web application. The junior developer is allowed to use any AI tool, while the senior developer must rely solely on their technical skills, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and other resources. Initially, the junior developer’s application might appear more polished and feature-rich. However, the true test comes when both are asked to make small changes without the aid of AI tools. The junior developer, accustomed to AI assistance, might struggle to implement these changes efficiently and bug-free. In contrast, the senior developer, with a deep understanding of the fundamentals, can make the necessary adjustments smoothly. This scenario highlights a critical issue: Junior developers may be skipping essential learning steps by relying too heavily on AI tools. The Importance of Fundamentals One of the major problems observed in junior developers today is a lack of interest in learning the fundamentals. They often want to jump straight into advanced topics and tools without building a strong foundation. This approach can lead to a superficial understanding of technology, making it difficult to troubleshoot issues or adapt to new challenges without AI assistance. The Future of Software Development Despite the concerns, it’s unlikely that software developers or engineers will lose their jobs to AI. Instead, Artificial Intelligence will likely change the workflow, making processes more efficient. The role of a software engineer might evolve, but it won’t be replaced by AI entirely. The idea of “Software Engineer 2.0” being synonymous with “Machine Learning Engineer” is a misconception. The future will still require developers with a solid grasp of fundamentals, who can use AI tools as an enhancement rather than a crutch. Adapting to the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven workforce A recent study conducted by Pearson, in partnership with ServiceNow, provides an extensive analysis of the potential effects of AI and automation on the economies of six countries (U.S., UK, Germany, India, Australia, and Japan) and how technology-based roles are expected to evolve. Despite concern from potentially affected groups, this research shows that junior application developers will remain valuable even as AI continues to evolve. The study suggests that in the coming years, those junior developers who can understand and adapt to their new roles will be best prepared to thrive in the AI-driven workforce of the future. The rise of AI and automation significantly impacts the skills required for junior developers to succeed in the tech industry. By analyzing their workflows and identifying areas where automation can provide the most significant value, developers can implement automation tools and processes, freeing time for more complex work. Project-based learning is a popular and effective way for new developers to gain hands-on experience and apply their coding skills to real-world challenges. However, this approach also presents its own set of unique challenges. Many new developers encounter pitfalls, but mastering code quality can set them apart in a competitive industry. Conclusion AI tools offer tremendous potential for accelerating development and enhancing productivity. However, for junior developers, over-reliance on these tools can be a double-edged sword. While they provide a quick path to creating complex applications, they can also hinder the learning of essential fundamentals. The key is to strike a balance: use AI tools to augment your skills, but never at the expense of understanding the core principles of software development. By doing so, junior developers can grow into well-rounded, competent professionals capable of adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer Sci-Fi, it’s here, transforming industries, and AI in healthcare is one of the most promising yet complex domains it’s reshaping. From detecting cancer in medical scans to predicting strokes before they occur, AI has the potential to make healthcare faster, more efficient, and more precise. But alongside these advancements come technical hurdles, ethical dilemmas, and critical questions about how much control we should give to algorithms in life-and-death decisions. So, what does the future of AI in healthcare look like? Let’s explore. The Promise of AI in Healthcare AI in medicine is like having a supercharged doctor with a photographic memory and lightning-fast thinking. It’s already changing the game, spotting diseases like Alzheimer’s and breast cancer earlier and more accurately than ever. Hospitals are using AI to cut down ER wait times and manage resources better, while in drug discovery, breakthroughs like DeepMind’s AlphaFold are rewriting the rules of protein research. Imagine taking a pill crafted exclusively for you designed to target your condition with laser precision, minimize side effects, and accelerate recovery. That’s the promise of personalized medicine. At a biomedical hackathon at Kathmandu University, I got a deep dive into human genetics and discovered how genetic sequencing, protein interactions, and biomarker analysis could unlock this future. Of course, challenges like data privacy and algorithmic bias remain, but one thing is clear-AI is revolutionizing healthcare in the best way possible. Key Challenges in Implementation of AI in HealthCare With great power comes great responsibility-and AI in healthcare is the Spider-Man of modern medicine. It’s got all this dazzling potential, but sorry, folks, it’s not as easy as flicking an “on” switch and calling it a day. AI depends on vast amounts of high-quality data, but medical records are often scattered, incomplete, or trapped in outdated systems. When AI feeds on bad data, it produces unreliable predictions, leading to potential misdiagnoses and treatment errors. The challenge isn’t just collecting data but ensuring it is accurate, standardized, and accessible. Then there’s the cost challenge. Developing and implementing AI isn’t inexpensive-it takes a significant investment for hospitals to bring it on board. Smaller clinics and less-funded regions often can’t keep up, watching from the sidelines as larger institutions adopt the technology. This isn’t just unfortunate-it could deepen the gap in healthcare access, where advanced AI tools are mostly available to well-resourced facilities. Patient care shouldn’t feel exclusive, should it? Then there’s the issue of trust. Doctors aren’t always eager to embrace algorithms-they’ve spent years building their expertise through hands-on experience, not managing software. Many view AI with skepticism, unsure of its role in their practice. Without thorough training and clear evidence that AI supports rather than replaces their judgment, adoption will likely remain gradual. AI’s role in healthcare must be that of an assistant, not an authority-augmenting human expertise rather than attempting to replace it. The potential? Oh, it’s huge -AI could be the rockstar of healthcare. But if we don’t tackle these hiccups, it might just end up as another overhyped gadget gathering dust in the corner. Ethical Concerns Beyond technical and financial barriers, AI in healthcare raises serious ethical questions. Let’s ensure this revolution succeeds, time to address the challenges thoughtfully and focus on effective solutions! Privacy and Data Security AI requires access to extensive patient data to function effectively, but this poses risks. Medical records contain highly sensitive information-who controls access, and how can we ensure data remains secure? Patients deserve transparency and strict safeguards against breaches or misuse. Bias and Fairness AI systems learn from old data, and sometimes that data has a few sneaky flaws. If it shortchanges certain groups, the AI might not treat everyone fairly. Case in point: one fancy AI once underestimated Black patients’ needs because it was fed healthcare spending stats that weren’t quite balanced. Fixing these little hiccups is a must to keep AI healthcare fair for all. Accountability and Trust When AI makes a medical error, who is responsible-the doctor, the developer, or the algorithm itself? Unlike human professionals, AI cannot explain its reasoning in a way we always understand, making accountability difficult. Trust in AI requires transparency, rigorous testing, and the ability for healthcare providers to interpret and validate AI recommendations. NeuroVision: A Case Study in Responsible AI Development One project that highlights AI’s potential, when developed responsibly, is NeuroVision. This initiative uses AI to classify brain tumors from DICOM medical images, based on a proposed technical architecture that integrates deep learning models with cloud-based processing for improved speed and accuracy. The dataset for this system is developed using Functional APIs, which enable efficient handling and structuring of complex medical imaging data. If implemented with proper ethical considerations, it could significantly enhance early tumor detection, leading to faster diagnoses and improved treatment planning. However, for NeuroVision to succeed ethically, several factors must be addressed: Data Transparency & Security : Ensuring patient imaging data is handled with the highest standards of encryption and privacy protection. Bias Mitigation : Training the model on diverse datasets to avoid racial, gender, or socioeconomic disparities in diagnosis. Explainability : Implementing explainable AI (XAI) techniques to help radiologists understand why the AI reached a particular conclusion, rather than treating it as a “black box.” Collaboration with Medical Experts : Ensuring that NeuroVision remains a tool that assists radiologists rather than replaces them, maintaining human oversight in critical decisions. If developed with these ethical pillars in mind, NeuroVision could set an example for responsible AI integration in healthcare, proving that innovation and responsibility can go hand in hand. The Road Ahead: Balancing Innovation and Responsibility The future of AI in healthcare all comes down to finding that sweet spot. We need strong rules to make sure AI plays fair, owns up to its mistakes, and keeps our data safe. And let’s be real-transparency matters. If patients and doctors can’t figure out how AI comes up with its answers, they’re not going to trust it, plain and simple. The trick is teamwork. AI techies, doctors, ethicists, and policymakers have to join forces to build systems that aren’t just cutting-edge but also decent and focused on people. Think of it like a three-legged stool: you’ve got innovation, responsibility, and trust holding it up. Kick one out, and the whole thing comes crashing down. The good news? We’re already seeing some wins. A few hospitals are testing out AI that explains itself, governments are sketching out ethics rules, and researchers are digging into the messy stuff like bias and fairness. Still, we’ve got a ways to go-nobody said this would be a quick fix! Conclusion AI could shake up healthcare-think of quicker diagnoses, sharper treatments, and healthier vibes all around. But let’s not kid ourselves: tech isn’t some magic fix-it wand. It’s more like a trusty tool, and we’ve got to use it right. The point isn’t to swap out doctors for robots-it’s to give them a boost so they can help us better. So, here’s the big question: Can we make sure AI’s got humanity’s back without messing up on ethics, fairness, or trust? If cool projects like NeuroVision show us how to do AI the responsible way, I’d say we’ve got a solid shot at a “heck yes.” What’s your take where do we set the boundaries? Upon hearing the term “Artificial Intelligence,” many immediately picture familiar virtual assistants such as Alexa and Siri, advanced technologies like ChatGPT, or iconic portrayals from movies like The Terminator or TV series such as the Kdrama My Holo Love. These instances often align with a narrow but prevalent perspective on AI, encapsulating contemporary innovations and cultural references that shape the ongoing history of artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence (AI) isn’t merely a futuristic idea confined to sci-fi realms; it’s a pervasive part of our everyday experiences. Whether it’s the personalized recommendations on streaming platforms like Netflix or the optimized routes suggested by ride-sharing services such as Pathao, AI permeates various aspects of modern life. This intricate ecosystem of interconnected technologies has steadily evolved over decades, contributing to its current complexity and ubiquity. Understanding the history of AI unveils a layered narrative, showcasing the diverse tools and capabilities that have molded it into the game-changing force it represents today. Tracing the trajectory of AI’s development is key to comprehending its present importance and preparing for its future implications. By examining its origins and evolutionary path, we gain valuable insights into how AI has transformed from a conceptual idea into a transformative technology that profoundly influences our daily routines and shapes industries across the spectrum. grasping the past paves the way for harnessing the potential of AI in our ever-evolving world. History of Artificial Intelligence from Academic Roots to Practical Progress AI’s origins lie within the academic halls of prestigious university research departments, initially pondered by scholars envisioning computing’s future. However, its infancy tethered it to these domains, hampered by scarce data and limited computational prowess. A pivotal moment arose in 1956 at Dartmouth College, where the renowned Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence convened. This workshop aimed to validate the notion that machines could simulate learning with precision-a groundbreaking hypothesis explored by 20 researchers. In subsequent years, significant strides marked AI’s trajectory. American psychologist Frank Rosenblatt’s perceptron algorithm, born from Dartmouth’s research, demonstrated successful binary classification, offering glimpses into artificial neurons’ learning potential. Concurrently, John McCarthy, an attendee of the Dartmouth project, along with MIT students, pioneered Lisp , a novel programming language laying the groundwork for future advancements like the SHRDLU natural language program and others. The 1960s witnessed the emergence of Simulmatics , a company claiming to predict voting patterns based on demographics. By 1965, “ expert systems ” surfaced, allowing AI to tackle specialized problems using factual databases and inference engines. MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum’s Eliza in 1966 showcased AI’s intelligence by engaging users as pseudo-therapists, responding to their inputs with open-ended questions. However, by the mid-1970s, dwindling faith in AI among governments and corporations led to funding shortages, marking the onset of the “AI winter.” Despite brief revivals in the 1980s and 1990s, AI remained largely relegated to science fiction, steering clear of serious computer science discourse. It wasn’t until the late 1990s and early 2000s that AI saw widespread adoption of machine learning techniques, including Bayesian methods from spam filtering by Microsoft and collaborative filtering for Amazon recommendations, marking a resurgence in AI’s practical applications. AI in the 21st Century: Revolutionary Pilot Programs and Real-world Applications During the 2000s, a confluence of factors, including increased computing power, expansive datasets, and the ascent of open-source software, empowered developers to engineer advanced algorithms. This technological wave promised swift and transformative change across scientific, consumer, manufacturing, and business sectors within a remarkably brief period. Today, AI is an integral part of numerous business operations, attaining tangible reality. For instance, McKinsey’s research highlights a staggering 400 instances where companies actively leverage AI to tackle various business challenges. These real-world applications of AI exemplify its widespread adoption and effectiveness in addressing multifaceted business issues. Likewise, in the early to mid-2000s web revolution introduced significant changes to AI research. Foundational technologies like Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Google’s PageRank altered data organization, facilitating AI integration. XML played a crucial role in shaping the semantic web and bolstering search engine capabilities, while PageRank redefined web organization. These innovations enhanced data accessibility for AI, rendering vast amounts of information more navigable. Simultaneously, database improvements in data storage and retrieval, alongside advancements in functional programming languages, streamlined data manipulation for developers and researchers. These combined tools provided a fertile ground for advancing AI technology. Artificial Intelligence’s Potential: Evolution through Neural Networks and Deep Learning AI held ambitious promises throughout the 20th century, yet limited computing power posed significant barriers to realizing these ambitions. However, as the 21st century dawned, computers underwent an exponential surge in capability, becoming proficient in storing, processing, and analyzing massive volumes of data. This paradigm shift paved the way for translating the ambitious goals of neural networks and deep learning into tangible realities. Researchers made strides by curating datasets explicitly tailored for machine training, culminating in the creation of neural networks like AlexNet . Unlike earlier methods reliant on datasets numbering in the tens of thousands, advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) allowed for datasets to reach tens of millions, significantly enhancing machine learning capabilities. In 2006, Nvidia, a leading computer chip manufacturer, introduced CUDA , a parallel computing platform that harnessed the power of GPUs to drastically accelerate computational speeds. This monumental leap facilitated the execution of large, intricate machine-learning models through platforms such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, propelling innovation in the field. As these platforms evolved into open-source libraries, they democratized AI, enabling widespread experimentation.

As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor ? The rise of IoT (Internet of Things) is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system ‘ IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor ’ is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. There’s usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 (Temperature-Humidity Sensor) Bread Board DS18B20 (Water Temperature Sensor) Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil & Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, let’s understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the project’s outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result & Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ide’s serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometer’s serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of . I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway College’s research lab and beyond that.

{"id": "sunway_160", "source": "https://sunway.edu.np/category/blog/reasons-developers-choose-rust/page/3/", "title": "No Title", "content": "The Rise of Rust: Why Developers Love It Generative AI revolutionizes the creative process by allowing humans to supervise while machines generate. This shift relieves us from tedious, risky, and challenging tasks. Similarly, it also enables us to concentrate on the core aspects of our work: vision, ideas, and purpose. It represents a transformative change in the future of employment. Importance of Generative AI Generative AI, like photography and celluloid film, represents an incredible creative revolution. It reduces the necessity for creative skill in painting or singing, just as photography emancipated us from relying entirely on artists to depict the truth. The influence of Generative AI goes beyond creativity. It gives rapid access to clear information and the automatic development of varied material. Material such as news stories, product descriptions, bespoke designs, music, visual effects, and more. It is redefining specialized professions. Additionally, it is also redefining our view of work. AI models increasingly aid with repetitive or computational activities in the manufacturing process. How is Generative AI different from other AI? In contrast to other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI focuses on producing new material, whereas discriminative AI classifies existing data. Generative AI is used for picture production, video synthesis , language generation, and music composition. It is one of the subcategories of artificial intelligence. It encompasses various activities done by AI systems. Reactive machines for self-driving cars, limited memory AI for weather forecasting, theory of mind for virtual customer assistance, narrow AI for personalized product suggestions in e-commerce, supervised learning for object identification, unsupervised learning for fraud detection in banking, and reinforcement learning for teaching machines to play games are all examples of these tasks. Generative AI encompasses several of these areas and continues to grow, with its primary goal being the production of new material, whether writing, graphics, or product suggestions. How does Generative AI work? To recognize patterns and produce new results, generative AI employs techniques such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms. It learns the basic principles guiding the content by studying a vast dataset. It generates fresh data by sampling from a previously learned distribution. The model refines the output to fit the desired outcome through a process known as “inference,” making it more realistic and aligned with user preferences. Generative AI Models 1. Natural Language Model Natural Language Model is the most well-known model of Generative AI, with ChatGPT making headlines. The majority of the excitement around text-based Generative AI is centered on a model known as GPT-3. It’s a language model created by OpenAI, a research group dedicated to the development and promotion of friendly AI. For example, while computers cannot “understand” language in the same way that humans can, natural language technologies are becoming more effective at identifying the context and meaning of phrases and words and converting them into suitable responses-and actions. 2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a well-known form of Generative AI. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator that work together to enhance the generator’s ability to generate realistic data. Over time, the generator improves its capacity to synthesize lifelike data, resulting in the creation of new items, assets, faces, and even people. GANs can be utilized for various applications, including generating natural features such as lightning, leaves, roots, eyes, and flowers, as well as seamlessly integrating humans with nature. Furthermore, in the context of financial fraud detection, GAN models can generate synthetic fraudulent transactions to train fraud detection algorithms. 3. VAE and Anomaly Detection Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are a major model used for anomaly identification. It entails training the model on a collection of normal data and then utilizing it to detect occurrences that deviate from the norm. VAE has applications in a variety of fields, including financial fraud detection, discovering defects in manufacturing processes, and detecting network breaches. For example, Google has used VAE to identify network attacks. Future Prediction Generative AI will continue to play a critical role in computer graphics, animation, and 3D modeling in the gaming, film, and marketing industries. It will also be employed in the next decade or so to improve virtual assistants’ and chatbots’ natural language understanding, allowing them to conduct complicated discussions. In the future, generative AI will help to create realistic simulations in sectors like architecture and engineering, create new materials and products in manufacturing and textile design, and aid in natural language production for news articles, novels, and movie screenplays. Conclusion In terms of utility and predictability, generative AI is similar to a camera, acting as a powerful instrument in the hands of people. Just like a camera performs reliably, generative AI follows the same pattern each time it is used. It enables people to use their skills to generate content, develop new solutions, and explore creative possibilities. Users may leverage the potential of generative AI to improve productivity, accelerate improvements, and stimulate discoveries by understanding and utilizing its consistent nature.

Threads allow you to see a feed of everything that’s going on with your friends or persons you’re interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? They’ve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before they’re able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because it’s linked to your Instagram account, you won’t have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads’ unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new People’s Choice hero. They’ve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside. Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment. What makes Twitter differ from Threads? Threads vs Twitter Twitter’s unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives. The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union. Automatic Status Sharing The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations. Threads intelligently recognize and share information about a user’s current status, such as location, movement, or even the music they are listening to, using powerful AI algorithms . While these capabilities may raise privacy concerns for some users, the app assures that users control information sharing, emphasizing transparency and consent. Conclusion Threads intended to debut in a minimal, stable state for V1, resembling Twitter with deliberate Instagram design aspects. Moreover, it is appropriately called since users have begun to refer to Threads as strings of messages, and it’s straightforward, with your newsfeed consisting of individuals you follow and those you don’t. It nails the basics-visually appealing, runs smoothly, almost bug-free-making it a less overwhelming alternative to Twitter.

Fines and Accountability With fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bill’s broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the “wrong intention,” means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media Landscape The implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital Environment As Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

Generative AI revolutionizes the creative process by allowing humans to supervise while machines generate. This shift relieves us from tedious, risky, and challenging tasks. Similarly, it also enables us to concentrate on the core aspects of our work: vision, ideas, and purpose. It represents a transformative change in the future of employment. Importance of Generative AI Generative AI, like photography and celluloid film, represents an incredible creative revolution. It reduces the necessity for creative skill in painting or singing, just as photography emancipated us from relying entirely on artists to depict the truth. The influence of Generative AI goes beyond creativity. It gives rapid access to clear information and the automatic development of varied material. Material such as news stories, product descriptions, bespoke designs, music, visual effects, and more. It is redefining specialized professions. Additionally, it is also redefining our view of work. AI models increasingly aid with repetitive or computational activities in the manufacturing process. How is Generative AI different from other AI? In contrast to other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI focuses on producing new material, whereas discriminative AI classifies existing data. Generative AI is used for picture production, video synthesis , language generation, and music composition. It is one of the subcategories of artificial intelligence. It encompasses various activities done by AI systems. Reactive machines for self-driving cars, limited memory AI for weather forecasting, theory of mind for virtual customer assistance, narrow AI for personalized product suggestions in e-commerce, supervised learning for object identification, unsupervised learning for fraud detection in banking, and reinforcement learning for teaching machines to play games are all examples of these tasks. Generative AI encompasses several of these areas and continues to grow, with its primary goal being the production of new material, whether writing, graphics, or product suggestions. How does Generative AI work? To recognize patterns and produce new results, generative AI employs techniques such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms. It learns the basic principles guiding the content by studying a vast dataset. It generates fresh data by sampling from a previously learned distribution. The model refines the output to fit the desired outcome through a process known as “inference,” making it more realistic and aligned with user preferences. Generative AI Models 1. Natural Language Model Natural Language Model is the most well-known model of Generative AI, with ChatGPT making headlines. The majority of the excitement around text-based Generative AI is centered on a model known as GPT-3. It’s a language model created by OpenAI, a research group dedicated to the development and promotion of friendly AI. For example, while computers cannot “understand” language in the same way that humans can, natural language technologies are becoming more effective at identifying the context and meaning of phrases and words and converting them into suitable responses-and actions. 2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a well-known form of Generative AI. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator that work together to enhance the generator’s ability to generate realistic data. Over time, the generator improves its capacity to synthesize lifelike data, resulting in the creation of new items, assets, faces, and even people. GANs can be utilized for various applications, including generating natural features such as lightning, leaves, roots, eyes, and flowers, as well as seamlessly integrating humans with nature. Furthermore, in the context of financial fraud detection, GAN models can generate synthetic fraudulent transactions to train fraud detection algorithms. 3. VAE and Anomaly Detection Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are a major model used for anomaly identification. It entails training the model on a collection of normal data and then utilizing it to detect occurrences that deviate from the norm. VAE has applications in a variety of fields, including financial fraud detection, discovering defects in manufacturing processes, and detecting network breaches. For example, Google has used VAE to identify network attacks. Future Prediction Generative AI will continue to play a critical role in computer graphics, animation, and 3D modeling in the gaming, film, and marketing industries. It will also be employed in the next decade or so to improve virtual assistants’ and chatbots’ natural language understanding, allowing them to conduct complicated discussions. In the future, generative AI will help to create realistic simulations in sectors like architecture and engineering, create new materials and products in manufacturing and textile design, and aid in natural language production for news articles, novels, and movie screenplays. Conclusion In terms of utility and predictability, generative AI is similar to a camera, acting as a powerful instrument in the hands of people. Just like a camera performs reliably, generative AI follows the same pattern each time it is used. It enables people to use their skills to generate content, develop new solutions, and explore creative possibilities. Users may leverage the potential of generative AI to improve productivity, accelerate improvements, and stimulate discoveries by understanding and utilizing its consistent nature.

Threads allow you to see a feed of everything that’s going on with your friends or persons you’re interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? They’ve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before they’re able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because it’s linked to your Instagram account, you won’t have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads’ unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new People’s Choice hero. They’ve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside. Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment. What makes Twitter differ from Threads? Threads vs Twitter Twitter’s unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives. The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union. Automatic Status Sharing The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations. Threads intelligently recognize and share information about a user’s current status, such as location, movement, or even the music they are listening to, using powerful AI algorithms . While these capabilities may raise privacy concerns for some users, the app assures that users control information sharing, emphasizing transparency and consent. Conclusion Threads intended to debut in a minimal, stable state for V1, resembling Twitter with deliberate Instagram design aspects. Moreover, it is appropriately called since users have begun to refer to Threads as strings of messages, and it’s straightforward, with your newsfeed consisting of individuals you follow and those you don’t. It nails the basics-visually appealing, runs smoothly, almost bug-free-making it a less overwhelming alternative to Twitter.

It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content. 📈 Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friend’s data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization , boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021 . Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If we’re going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas . But first we’ll need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Let’s start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python : a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. We’ll also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Let’s perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friend’s assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friend’s aggregations, we’re limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path \"datasets/netflix_data.csv\" . Let’s create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friend’s data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type . Scanning the column, it’s clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show (perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons)? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie . While we’re at it, we don’t need information from all of the columns, so let’s create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title , country , genre , release_year , and duration . Let’s put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. We’ve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Let’s try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so let’s try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much rmative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Let’s filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as “Children”, “Stand-Up”, and “Documentaries”. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For rmation, you can refer to the documentation here ! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, we’ll also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use() . The latter isn’t taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find rmation on customizing the style of your plot here ! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as children’s movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we can’t know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, you’ve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas . This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas . We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri If you are a +2 graduate who is thinking of applying for Merit Based IT Scholarship worth Rs.2 crore for BSc (Hons) Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence (AI) , please see below to check if the college from which you graduated +2 is a partner institution with DigiSchool and UK colleges: Partner Institutions - DigiSchool: Aksharaa School Amrit Secondary Boarding School Baba School Baby Star Montessori Pvt.

Welcome Welcome to Birmingham City University. You are now part of one of the largest Universities in the United Kingdom that attracts students from all backgrounds from across the region, the country and the rest of the world. With 25,000 students from 80 countries, Birmingham City University is a university with an international outlook. The University also works in partnership with other higher education institutions and organis ations not only in the United Kingdom but in countries around the world. These partnerships provide opportunities for students to study at a centre local to them on a course that leads to an award of the University. You are studying for a Birmingham City University award through one of our partnerships. Throughout this Handbook we will refer to the place where you are studying i.e. Sunway International Business School, located at Maitidev, Kathmandu , as either the ‘partner organisation’ or as Sunway . This Handbook is one of several important documents that you will receive during your time as a Birmingham City University student. We urge you to read this Handbook and to keep it as a reference tool for the duration of your studies. Faculty of Computing, En gineering and t he Built Environment (CEBE) The Faculty of Computing, Engineering and The Built Environment was formed in early 2009. The Faculty comprises two schools: the School of Computing and Digital Technology and the School of Engineering and the Built Environment. Together as a Faculty we respond dynamically to the multiple modern technological challenges posed by fast-paced industries. As a faculty , our vision is to create a powerful centre of technological excellence and innovation, to educate to the highest quality in technologies and engineering and to equip students with the technical skills to contribute to the workplace as well as to the wider industry. School of Comput ing and Digital Technology ( CDT) The School of the Computing and Digital Technology is a major provider of professionally relevant courses for computing and digital industries. We are a modern, multi -disciplinary and diverse educational champion of the computing environment, offering courses dedicated to the teaching of future professionals. Our core activity is educating professionals for a technical, ethical, economic, political and social world where the computer and data environment forms the context for human activity. The success of our courses is due to our balanced approach to learning which incorporates research, scholarship and industry engagement, together with practice. Our teaching and assessment are driven by a commitment to creating highly competent practitioners who can continue to develop not only themselves but the wider industry. Problem solving, teamwork and wider appreciation are actively encouraged, with functional and procedural knowledge as a support . 6 SECTION 2 Getting Started Induction and Enrolment Sunway will arrange a welcome orientation session which will be followed by an induction session. Attendance is compulsory for all new students. Welcome orientation sessions will provide you with important information about your course including the learning, teaching and assessment methods that will be used and what will be expected of you. You will receive an introduction to your institution, the facilities and the learning resources as well as meeting the members of the teaching and support staff and your fellow students. You will also be required to enrol as a student of Sunway as well as Birmingham City University (‘the University’). In order to enrol , you will need to provide the following: • Original birth certificate or passport. • Original certificate or official results notification of all qualifications that are listed on your application form. • Payment for your fees or a sponsor letter confirming payment. As part of the enrolment process, you will be asked by your partner institution to complete an enrolment form. You will be asked to provide details of your legal name, home and term time addresses and all previous qualifications. Other personal details will be required for statistical purposes. Your partner institution will send your enrolment information to Birmingham City University so that we can then enrol you as a student of the University. Once we have set up an electronic record for you on our database, you will be issued with a unique identification number, a Birmingham City University Network ID and password and a personal Birmingham City University email account. This email address will be used by the University to communicate useful and official information. You will also need your password to access the online learning facilities on the University’s intranet (called iCity) and Moodle. The amount of fees due will be stated on your enrolment form/payment schedule and you must honour your fee payment on or before enrolment deadline of each semester as stipulated by Sunway . It is a condition of enrolment that you accept full responsibility for the payment of all course fees and any other fees that you incur at your first registration as a student on the course . You may apply for late modules enrolment each semester by submi ssion of relevant application form and pay relevant fees. Late applications being accepted are subject to approval. You are required to pay fees to Sunway as per the fee structure and payment schedule provided to you at the time of admission. Campus Infor mation Sunway is located Behind Maitidevi Temple, Maitidevi, Kathmandu , Nepal . All classes will be conducted at this location. Students should refer to their respective timetable for the location of classes. Key Contacts at Sunway Students are required to contact Student Services Department should they need assistance on any topic. The queries will be assigned to concerned department by the Student Services Manager for further actions. 7 Student Services Manager Mrs. Sabina Kasaju Joshi [EMAIL] Tel: 01 -4531725, 4 523736 Registry, Timetable and Examination Manager Mrs. Aastha Lamsal [EMAIL] Tel: 01 -4531725, 4523736 8 Y our Course SECTION 3 Cours e Specification Every course offered by the University has a course specification. A course specification is a concise description of the knowledge, understanding and skills you should have gained on successful completion of the course as well as information about how you will be taught and how you will be assessed (for example by written examination or coursework assignment). The course specification for your course can be viewed online here. Module S pecifications Each course is broken down into a number of modules, where each module is a single unit of study. A module specification provides an overview of a module, including the aims of the mo dule, learning outcomes, teaching methods, a list of the topics that will be taught, the assessment criteria and indicative reading (key texts). Placement Y ear You will complete two years o f your p rogramme b efore b eginning a 9 -12 m onth f ull-time p lacement in industry, w here y ou w ill ga in h ands -on e xperience in a real- world w ork e nvironment, before continuing with your c ourse. For your s ummative a ssessment, you must p resen t evidence from r eal-work p rojects d emonstrating the ap plication of all the k nowledge, skills, and b ehaviours o utlined i n the p lacement m odule specification. Training Se mesters After the completion of Level 4 and Level 5, students are required to compulsorily undertake Training Semester 1 and Training Semester 2, respectively. These semesters consist of non -credit modules designed to bridge the gap between academic learning and industry requirements. The training modules are an integral part of the program, and successful completion of these courses is mandatory for all students to progress to next level of their academic journey. All the courses offered during these semesters are validated from BCU. Course Timetable A timetable will be issued to you by your partner institution during your induction. Learning and Teaching Methods Key concepts will be introduced through lectures and will be explored further during seminars, workshops, lectures from visiting speakers, in-c lass and forum debates and through self- directed/independent study. Case studies are used to explore concepts applied to real-world scenarios. Experiential learning is encouraged via project-b ased assignments. Analysis, synthesis and evaluation are developed as themes throughout the course. Information and discussion forums will be available on Moodle (see S ection 5: Resources) for participants to provide a support network to complement lectures, seminars and workshops. One of the key aspects of higher education study is self-d irected/independent learning and you will be expected to undertake independent study outside of your timetabled lectures and seminars. Don’t rely on your lecture notes for all the information you’ll need for an assessment. It is really important that you do some independent research, for example, by reading through some of the additional textbooks suggested by your teaching team. 9 Language of Delivery and Assessment All of your course will be taught and assessed through the medium of English. English language support sessions will be made available to any student seeking supplementary support. rmation about the language support sessions is available from your Course Leader or tutor. 10 SECTION 4 Assessment Information How You Will Be Assessed A wide variety of assessment approaches are used throughout the course . These include structured tasks, presentations, practical work, academic writing (articles, b usiness reports and academic papers), individual or group projects and examinations. Your tutor will issue you with assessment briefs that contain the specific details of individual assessments. The assessment briefs are changed annually and therefore cannot be published in the Handbook. More detailed information about how a particular module will be assessed can be found in the module specifications. Assessment Regulations, Policies & Procedures The University has a series of regulations, policies and procedures that govern your academic experience and all members of staff and all students are required to observe these during their time at the University. It is therefore important that you familiarise yourself with these regulations, policies and procedures. You can find the full set of University regulations, policies and procedures on the University intranet . The way in which your work is assessed is covered by the University’s Assessment Regulations. The regulations include information about: • Modules, levels of modules and the credits which attach to them. • Requirements for passing modules. • Requirements for progression to the next level of your course. • How to achieve an award with Commendation or Distinction and how degree classifications are calculated. • What happens if you fail a module ? Assignment Submission You will be submitting several pieces of coursework work over the academic year and it is important that you keep the following in mind: Specific submission instructions can be found on the Moodle page for the module for which you are submitting work. Your work may not be graded if you do not follow the instructions . • You must submit a coversheet provided by the module tutor as the first page alongside any summative assessment submitted via Turnitin. • It is your responsibil ity to ensure that the correct work is submitted. The file(s) electronically submitted at the deadline will be considered the final and complete submitted work, with no amendments or additions permitted after the deadline. • You are responsible for ensuring that electronic files submitted are in one of the acceptable file formats and are not corrupted. Students should double -check files on the system after they have been submitted to ensure they are valid and correct. When an assignment is successfully submi tted through Turnitin, an email receipt is automatically sent to confirm the submission. Please keep all receipts, as they will be used to confirm successful submission in the unlikely event of a technical failure. If Turnitin reports an error while submit ting, please make a note of it and notify the module tutor immediately. 11 Extenuating Circumstances/Mitigating Circumstances and Extensions to Deadlines If you can’t submit an assignment or attend an exam for valid reasons beyond your control (for example, if you are ill) you can apply under the University’s procedures for the consideration of exceptional circumstances for either: • A Review of Performance (which means that you will take the assessment at the next available opportunity). OR • A coursework extension of 10 working days from the coursework deadline. You must make sure you submit your request, with evidence (i.e. a doctor’s note if you are ill), at least 7 working days before the exam/assessment deadline. The full procedures are available on iCity . Late Submission If you do not have exceptional circumstances but submit your first attempt of an assessment after the published deadline, the following penalties will be applied: • If a first attempt at an assessment is submitted between 1 and 24 hours after the published submission deadline, the mark will be reduced by 5%. • If a first attempt at an assessment is submitted between 24 hours an d one week (5 working days) after the published submission deadline the original mark awarded will be reduced by 10%. • For a first attempt, work will not be accepted more than one week (5 working days) after the original deadline. A mark of 0 and a non -subm ission will be recorded. • For a resubmission attempt, if a student submits more than 1 hour after the published deadline the student will be deemed to have failed the attempt and the assessment will be returned to the student unmarked If you have longer term problems which you think are likely to last more than three weeks, you should ask your tutor whether you should apply for a Suspension of Studies (SOS) from the course. Further information is available in Section 7: Frequently Asked Questions . Reassessment If you have not passed a module at the first attempt, you may be eligible for re-assessment. If you do re-sit a module without extenuating circumstances, your mark will be capped at the pass mark i.e. the maximum mark that you can achieve will be the pass mark. All fees, charges and payment schedule are posted at Sunway’s reception for student easy reference. Academic Misconduct Academic Misconduct is often referred to as ‘cheating’ or ‘plagiarism’ and can take a variety of forms. Although it may be intentional or unintentional, the University takes allegations of academic misconduct very seriously. Cheating is considered a disciplinary offence if a student attempts to gain or helps someone else to gain an unfair advantage over other students . Students who are suspected of cheating will have to attend a formal hearing to explain their case, and if found guilty of cheating the penalties can be severe, including the removal of academic credit or even your permanent expulsion from the University. Some examples of academic misconduct are included below, but the list is not exhaustive and cheating in assessed work may take other forms: 12 Cheating in examinations: • Attempting to access confidential information before an examination, including trying to get sight of the examination paper before it is published. • Taking or attempting to take unauthorised material, including blank paper, electronic devices and mobile phones, into an examination room. • Communicating or attempting to communi cate in any way with another candidate or any other person (other than the invigilator) during an examination. • Copying, or trying to copy, the work of another student. • Allowing or assisting another student to copy. • Impersonation - taking an assessment on behalf of, or pretending to be, another student, or allowing another person to take an assessment on behalf of a student. • Attempting to remove script books, including blank script books, from an examination room. Plagiarism : This is the submission of an item of assessment, which all or in part, contains work produced by another person(s) in such a way that it could be assumed to be the stu dent’s own work. Plagiarism also includes a lack of ‘in -text’ referencing. Collusion: This is where there has been improper collaboration (or working together) in the production of a piece of work, which is then submitted as entirely the work of an individual. It is important to note that except where written instructions state that work for assessment may be produced jointly and submitted as the work of more than one s tudent, (often referred to as ‘group work’), students must not collaborate with other students to produce a piece of work jointly. Furthermore , students should not copy or share another student’s work, lend their work to another student or allow another student to copy their work. Falsification of data or artefacts: This is where students invent data or change their material in order to support an argument. Examples of such behaviour include inventing false responses to questionnaires and interviews and amending test results/figures. Duplication: This is the submission of a piece of work in whole or in part that has already been submitted for assessment elsewhere, including concurrent submissions. To find out how you can avoid allegations of cheating, it is strongly suggested that you visit our assessment guide, which is available on iCity . To help you understand how to reference correctly, please seek advice from your tutors or familiarise yourself with information on avoiding plagiarism provided by the University . Here are a few simple principles to follow to avoid allegations of cheating: In exams: • Don’t attempt to see the paper before it is published. • Don’t ask another student for help during the exam or copy another student’s work. • Don’t let another student copy your work. • Don’t take unauthorised materials into the exam room. 13 • Make sure you know what equipment/materials you can use in the exam (i.e. calculator) and make sure the permitted materials are clear of your additional notes and other recorded information. In coursework: • Don’t pass off someone else’s work as your own. This is plagiarism and is viewed very seriously by the University. • Acknowledge all sources that you have used in your assignment or project. For advice on referencing contact the Centre for Academic Success . • Use quotation marks if you are using the exact words of another person. • Don’t submit a piece of work that has already been submitted in whole or in part for an assessment elsewhere. This is called duplication and, like plagiarism, is viewed very seriously by the University. • Check with your course team whether you can work with others on your coursework, and if so, be sure about what you should be doing on your own. • Don’t allow others to copy your work or lend your work to other students. • Don’t make up data to prove your point. Assessment Results and Examination Boards At the end of your academic year and when you have completed all your assessments, an Examination Board meeting will be held. The Board is made up of staff from your institution, the University as well as the External Examiner (see below). The purpose of the meeting is to endorse the marks awarded to assessment. It is only after the Examination Board has confirmed your marks that you will receive confirmation of your results. Marking, Feedback an d the External Examiner When you hand in your work or sit an exam, your work will be marked as quickly as possible by the teaching team. Their marking will then be moderated within the Department or Faculty, to ensure that marks have been awarded fairly. Marking is carried out anonymously, wherever possible, so don’t worry, personal feelings are never taken into account when your work is being graded. To make sure that you are assessed fairly in relation to other students on the same course and to ensure the quality and standards of our courses are comparable to similar courses in other Universities, the University employs an External Examiner. An External Examiner is a qualified subject specialist who works in a UK university other than Birmingham City Un iversity. External examiners won’t be marking your work, but they will see a sample of assessed work to check the appropriateness of the standards and the marks awarded. The External Examiner will visit your centre at least once a year and you will have t he opportunity to talk to them about your experience - good and bad! - on the course . The visit may be on -site or virtual. Following the visit, the External Examiner will write a report that tells the University about the good practices at your centre and of any concerns they might have. External Examiner reports are made available to students and you can request a copy from your Course Leader . You’ll get feedback on your assessments, so make sure you go and collect your work once it’s been mark ed. Feedback is really useful as it includes the markers’ constructive comments on your assessment, including aspects of your work that could be improved, and it can also provide guidance and advice for future assessments. Please note that when you collect your work, you will receive an indication of how well you have done in your assessment and you may receive a mark for the work. However, remember that the mark is only indicative and is subject to change. You will receive the final mark after the meeting of the Examination Board. 14 Grading criteria Statements of grading criteria for each of the assessment criteria describe performance associated with the assessment criteria. The grading criteria are the basis upon which marks are accorded. Grading criteria for each module assessment are provided in the relevant assignment briefs. Error in the Conduct of an Assessment or an Examination Board If you consider that there has been an error or irregularity in an assessment, or at an examination board, you may submit a claim under the “Procedure for considering Claims of Error in the conduct of Assessment Processes”. To submit a claim you should complete a form called “Claim of an Error in the Conduct of Assessment Processes” which is available on iCity. at https://icity.bcu.ac.uk/academic - services/information -for-students . If you wish to m ake a claim you must do so within 15 working days of the publication of your results. If, for good reason, you cannot submit a claim within this timescale you should speak to your Tutor or Course Leader . Classification of Honours Degree (applicable for undergraduate course s only)  First Class (1st): 70% or above  Second Upper (2:1): 60-69%  Second Lower (2:2): 50-59%  Third Class (3rd): 40-49% The calculation method is the average marks of all modules, which the “Honours Research Project” count as double module, i.e. 2 modules. 15 SECTION 5 Student Resources Birmingham City University Network The Information and Communications Technology team is responsible for the data network, email and access to the Internet. To be able to access these you require a Network ID and password. These will be issued to you after you have been enrolled on university systems. When you have access to the network you will have a personal email address (account) available to you. This email address will be used by the University to communicate useful and official information. You will also need your password to make use of and access the online learning facilities, including Moodle. You can access this email address from anywhere on the internet . ￼You should check this email account on a frequent basis as this is where you will receive important updates about your course . When you access you University syst ems for the first time, you will be prompted to register for Multi- Factor Authentication (MFA. Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) is the process of using two or more independent factors to verify a user's identity for a login, and to access secure data. • The first factor is something known only to you - your BCU password. • The second factor is a single use code sent to your personal device OR a message sent asking for confirmation that you are attempting to log in. MFA means that you can reset your password yourself and helps to keep the University secure against cyber attacks. Moodle Moodle is a Virtual Learning Environment for all University students and staff and is the place to look for information to help you with your course . Not only are there useful links to key resources and websites, but it also brings together different forms of e -learning to enhance your learning experience. This includes quizzes, forums that enable you to ask tutors questions or to share experiences with fellow students as well as glossaries to explain complex terms. Other features include blogs which are personal spaces that allow you to reflect upon your own learning privately, Wikis which allow you to work collaboratively with oth er students and workshops which allow students to review each other’s work. Most modules are supported by Moodle; this means that Moodle will provide access to all sorts of resources such as lecture notes, PowerPoint presentations and, where available, video lectures and multimedia scenarios. Moodle is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and from anywhere in the world. You can access Moodle through the main Moodle website (link below). You will need your network ID and password to log into Moodle .

There are a number of ways you can express your opinion about your time on your course . You can speak directly to your course team or you can ask the Student Representative (see below) on your course to raise issues on your behalf at meetings that they attend with the course team throughout the year. You will also be given the opportunity to comment on the modules you have taken during the year. Student Representation Student Representatives (or Student Reps) are elected by students. They gather opinions from their fellow students, represent their views at meetings and feedback the outcome of these meetings to students to improve the quality of their experience. Student Representatives will be invited to attend the Board of Studies. This is a meeting that is held at least once per year and is attended by your Course Leader , teaching staff and administrative staff. It will provide you with the opportunity to discuss issues about your course and to make sure that your voice is heard. Students’ Union As a Birmingham City University student, you are automatically a member of y our Students’ Union, unless you choose to opt out.

If you think you want to leave your course, it’s a good idea to talk it through with your Tutor or Course Leader before making any final decisions. They can discuss your options with you. It is important that if you intend to withdraw from your course after enrolment you inform your Course Leader . You should state in writing that you wish to withdraw and you should indicate your last date of attendance. What if I want to take som e time out from the course? Taking time out is called a Suspension of Studies (SOS) , which is an approved leave of absence from all study and may be taken for a number of reasons e.g. health, financial, academic or personal. If you’re thinking about taking a Suspension of Studies , you should talk to Tutor or Course Leader first before completing the necessary paperwork and forms . It is your responsibility to inform the University if you intend to take a Suspension of Studies . You can apply for a Suspension of Studies for a maximum period of 12 months subject to the approval of the University. When you are due to your course after your Suspension of Studies, you need to contact your tutor. If you do not return at the end of your Suspension of studi es, you will need to apply for another Suspension of Studies (subject to approval) or be permanently withdrawn from the course. If a Permanently Withdrawn student wishes to reapply for their course, c redits achieved before the approved Suspension of Studi es may not be carried forward to the new registered study course subject to the approval of the University. How do I make a complaint? If you’re unhappy about any aspects of your experience as a Birmingham City University student, we want to know about it so talk to your Tutor or Course Leader . In many cases, they will be the best person to help you but if they are unable to resolve matters for you, you may need to refer to the University’s formal complaints procedure . What should I do if I change my name during my time at University? If you change your name during your studies and would like your new name to be used on your University records and award certificates, you must make a formal request to your Course Leader . You must make the request before you finish your course. No changes can be made to your student record after the final examination board for your course has met. You must provide evidence of your change of name. Acceptable forms of evidence are: • Passport • Marriage certificate • Birth certificate (original birth certificate issued within 12 months of birth) • Divorce decree absolute. Please note that your student number will remain the same throughout your course, even if you change your name. 19 SECTION 8 Refund policy (applicable in Nepal ) Refund process and mechanism. 1.

Executive Summary This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the publicly available staff and departmental contact information for as extracted from its official digital assets. The objective of this initiative was to identify, consolidate, and structure personnel data to produce a professional directory, complete with a detailed methodology and an analysis of data provenance. The findings presented herein are based on a systematic digital reconnaissance of the college's primary domain and associated downloadable documents. A total of 13 unique individuals were identified and profiled, representing a cross-section of the college's senior leadership, academic faculty, and administrative staff. A key finding of this reconnaissance was the limited availability of structured personnel data on the main web pages of the sunway.edu.np domain. The most authoritative and detailed information was successfully extracted from official, downloadable PDF brochures, which served as the cornerstone of the data collection effort. This reliance on static, offline documents for personnel information points to a specific digital content management approach. Overall confidence in the accuracy of the extracted data is considered high for key leadership and highlighted individuals. However, a significant discovery was a set of discrepancies in the roles assigned to several administrative staff members when comparing the 2022-23 and 2023-24 college brochures. This report includes a detailed analysis of these inconsistencies, providing a clear rationale for the data-cleaning and normalization process that led to the final, reconciled dataset. The findings are presented in a structured format, detailing leadership, departmental contacts, and a full directory, complemented by an appendix of raw data, a crawl log, and a list of sources. II. Leadership & Highlighted Individuals The analysis of 's digital assets reveals a clear distinction between the institution's senior leadership and the individuals it strategically highlights to showcase its academic and career-focused mission. Information on senior management is consistently presented in official, formal documents, while student and alumni profiles are prominently featured on the college's main website. Senior Management The college's senior leadership is comprised of long-standing figures whose roles and messages remain consistent across multiple years of publications. ● Mr. Bigyan Shrestha, Chairman: Mr. Shrestha is identified as the Chairman of Sunway College, a title consistently maintained across both the 2022-23 and 2023-24 versions of the college's official brochure. 1 A message from him is prominently featured in these documents, where he encourages prospective students and their parents to consider Sunway College as a \"high-quality, well-known, and affordable education institution\". 1 His stable presence across different publications indicates a foundational and continuing role at the helm of the institution. ● Mr. Pramod Poudel, Academic Director: Mr. Poudel holds the title of Academic Director, a role also consistently documented in the official brochures. 1 His message focuses on the college's commitment to providing a quality workforce and highlights its academic collaboration with Birmingham City University, UK. He describes this partnership as a \"perfect match between an institution based in Nepal with a global vision and an institution based in the UK with an international outlook and exposure\". 1 The permanence of both Mr. Shrestha and Mr. Poudel in these key roles across different years of official documentation lends high credibility to their entries in the final dataset. Highlighted Staff, Students, and Alumni In addition to its formal leadership, strategically features a number of individuals on its main website and in promotional materials. These profiles are designed to provide a compelling narrative of the college's impact on student success, particularly in the fields of technology and leadership. These individuals are explicitly identified in the final dataset by the highlighted field, which is set to true. The profiles of these individuals are not merely academic summaries but are rich with biographical context that directly connects their experiences to the college's value proposition. For instance, the testimonials from four students are prominently displayed on the homepage, detailing their academic journeys and career development. ● Prashanta Acharya: As a student from the November 2023 intake of the BSc (Hons) Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence program, Mr. Acharya's testimonial describes his experience at Sunway College as \"exceptional\" due to its \"top-tier resources, expert guidance, and a curriculum aligned with the latest technological advancements\". 3 His participation in extracurricular activities such as hackathons and industry collaborations is also highlighted. ● Sanket Shrestha: Also from the November 2023 intake, Mr. Shrestha's account emphasizes the role of the college in his \"personal and professional development.\" He expresses gratitude to his teachers and mentors and notes the numerous opportunities he has been given, including participation in \"over 7 hackathons, more than 50 tech events, and an abundance of networking opportunities\". 3 ● Pratikshya Karki: Her profile is particularly compelling as it demonstrates a progression of success. A student from the March 2023 intake, Ms. Karki served as the President of the Sunway Student Representative Council (2024/25) and, at the time of publication, was beginning her placement year as an \"AI Engineer at SunyaEk Computing.\" Her testimonial highlights the college's focus on developing leadership skills, soft skills, and industry readiness. 3 ● Udit Kumar Mahato: His profile is concise but impactful, noting that he was selected for the IIT Bombay International Summer School in 2024, an all-expenses-covered trip that was supported by Sunway College. 3 The practice of showcasing these student profiles on the college’s homepage provides a clear window into its institutional priorities. While other academic institutions might focus exclusively on the credentials of their faculty, 's decision to feature testimonials from students, and to explicitly link their academic experiences to career success and international opportunities, underscores a core institutional strategy. The college is not just marketing an academic curriculum; it is positioning itself as a career-enabler, with a stated commitment to providing \"100% Placement Support\". 4 This emphasis on tangible outcomes and industry readiness reveals the college's primary value proposition to prospective students.

Departmental & Staff Directory The following section presents a consolidated directory of all other personnel identified through the data collection process, organized by their respective departmental affiliations where specified. The data primarily originates from the official college brochures, which were the most fruitful sources for structured staff information. Academic Leadership & Course Coordinators The academic structure is organized around specific departments, with key individuals holding leadership roles. It is important to note that while the user query requested information for an \"IT\" department, the college's official materials refer to the academic unit as the \"Department of Computer Science.\" The profiles of the following individuals clarify this structure. ● Dr. Rajeev Kumar Shah: He is identified as the Course Director for the Department of Computer Science. 1 ● Shoba Sapkota: Ms. Sapkota is listed as the Course Director for the Department of Business and Marketing. 1 ● Rupak Koirala: Mr. Koirala holds the dual role of Senior Lecturer and Course Coordinator for the BSc (Hons) Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence program. 1 His position as a course coordinator directly links him to a specific academic offering, making him a critical contact for that program. Administrative & Operational Staff This category includes the individuals who manage the day-to-day operations, marketing, admissions, and student affairs of the college. The data collection process revealed a notable finding regarding several of these profiles, which will be discussed in detail in the following section. For the purpose of this directory, the most recent and authoritative information from the 2023-24 brochure has been used as the primary source of record. ● Manish Maharjan: Operation Manager at Sunway College. 2 ● Aastha Lamsal: ECA (Extra-Curricular Activities) Coordinator at Sunway College. 2 ● Sreani Khatiwada: Counselor at Sunway College. 2 ● Diwas Pradhan: Training and Placement Coordinator at Sunway College. 2 ● Nisha Gautam: Business Development/Admission Manager. 1 Her role is consistently listed across both brochures, adding a high degree of confidence to her profile. ● Reshma Oli: Marketing Officer at Sunway College. 1 Her role is also consistently listed across sources. ● Bibek Gautam: Teaching Assistant at Sunway College. 1 He is also noted as a NodeJs Developer at EKbana and a Sunway Alumni, which provides additional context to his profile. 1 A comprehensive consolidated directory of all identified staff and highlighted individuals is provided in the following table. This table includes their assigned department and role, alongside the source URL, and notes where relevant. The dataset produced for this report contains these records with all specified fields, including null values for missing information such as email and phone numbers. The analysis found that most personnel records do not include direct email or phone numbers; instead, the college relies on generic contact emails like [EMAIL] for general inquiries. 5 full_name role department source_url Mr. Bigyan Shrestha Chairman Administration https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2023/06/Sunw ay-Brochure-23-24. pdf Mr. Pramod Poudel Academic Director Administration https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2023/06/Sunw ay-Brochure-23-24. pdf Rupak Koirala Senior Lecturer, Course Coordinator Computer Science https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2023/06/Sunw ay-Brochure-23-24. pdf Dr. Rajeev Kumar Shah Course Director Computer Science https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2022/09/Sunw ay-Brochure-web-v ersion-2022-1.pdf Shoba Sapkota Course Director Business and Marketing https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2022/09/Sunw ay-Brochure-web-v ersion-2022-1.pdf Manish Maharjan Operation Manager Administration https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2023/06/Sunw ay-Brochure-23-24. pdf Aastha Lamsal ECA Coordinator Student Affairs https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2023/06/Sunw ay-Brochure-23-24. pdf Sreani Khatiwada Counselor Student Affairs https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2023/06/Sunw ay-Brochure-23-24. pdf Diwas Pradhan Training and Placement Coordinator Student Affairs https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2023/06/Sunw ay-Brochure-23-24. pdf Nisha Gautam Business Development / Admission Manager Business Development https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2023/06/Sunw ay-Brochure-23-24. pdf Reshma Oli Marketing Officer Marketing https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2023/06/Sunw ay-Brochure-23-24. pdf Bibek Gautam Teaching Assistant Computer Science https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2023/06/Sunw ay-Brochure-23-24. pdf Udit Kumar Mahato President, Sunway Student Representative Council Student Affairs https://sunway.edu. np/wp-content/uplo ads/2022/09/Sunw ay-Brochure-web-v ersion-2022-1.pdf Prashanta Acharya Student Computer Science https://sunway.edu. np/ Sanket Shrestha Student Computer Science https://sunway.edu. np/ Pratikshya Karki Student Computer Science https://sunway.edu. np/ IV. Data Provenance & Insights The process of compiling a definitive directory requires a meticulous approach to data provenance, especially when faced with inconsistencies across multiple sources. The analysis of the materials revealed specific challenges that necessitated a transparent and systematic resolution. Data Consistency Analysis & Discrepancy Resolution A critical finding was the presence of conflicting information regarding the roles of four key administrative staff members when comparing the 2022-23 and 2023-24 brochures. A side-by-side comparison revealed a pattern of role-swapping that, while potentially a result of genuine internal reassignments, is more likely to be a systemic data entry error in one of the source documents. The following matrix illustrates the discrepancies: Full Name Role in 2022-23 Brochure Role in 2023-24 Brochure Confidence Score Resolution Manish Maharjan Counselor Operation Manager High Prioritize 2023-24 data as most recent. Aastha Lamsal Training and Placement Coordinator ECA Coordinator High Prioritize 2023-24 data as most recent. Diwas Pradhan Operation Manager Training and Placement Coordinator High Prioritize 2023-24 data as most recent. Sreani Khatiwada ECA Coordinator Counselor High Prioritize 2023-24 data as most recent. This pattern of symmetrical role-swapping for the same individuals is highly unusual. The most recent brochure, dated 2023-24, is considered the most current representation of the college's organizational structure. Therefore, for the final dataset, the roles listed in the 2023-24 brochure have been prioritized and designated with a \"High\" confidence score. The conflicting information from the 2022-23 brochure has been archived in the notes field for each affected record, providing a complete audit trail. This approach ensures that the final directory is based on the most up-to-date information while also transparently documenting the data inconsistencies discovered during the analysis. Data Gaps & Observations The data collection process also identified several key gaps and observations that provide further context for the final output. ● Reliance on Offline Documents: The official website (sunway.edu.np) was found to be a poor source for structured personnel data. Key directories, such as the contact/ and blogs/ pages, were inaccessible at the time of the reconnaissance, returning errors. 7 As a result, the project's data collection methodology had to pivot from a traditional web crawl to a more forensic analysis of downloadable PDFs, which proved to be the most reliable source of personnel information. This underscores a significant limitation in the college's online data accessibility. ● Missing Departmental Contacts: While the college's brochures provided a clear structure for its academic and administrative staff, no specific personnel contacts were found for an \"Accounts\" department. This information gap is noted in the report and the final dataset. ● External Data Fragmentation: Initial searches on third-party aggregator websites provided general contact information for the college, including various phone numbers and emails. 5 However, the most authoritative contact information was found on the college's own sunway.edu.np domain, specifically in the FAQ section, which lists [EMAIL] and a phone number. 9 In cases of conflicting data, only information from official college domains or documents was used, ensuring the highest data quality. ● Institutional Identity: The initial reconnaissance encountered numerous digital assets for other Sunway College and University campuses, primarily in Malaysia (.edu.my domain). 10 A rigorous scope limitation to the sunway.edu.np domain was critical to prevent the conflation of data from these separate institutions, a crucial step for maintaining the integrity and focus of the directory. V. Methodology & Ethical Compliance The data acquisition and analysis were conducted in a structured, multi-phase process to ensure accuracy, completeness, and adherence to ethical guidelines. Data Collection Methodology 1. Phase 1: Broad Crawl and Sitemapping: An initial, broad-based crawl of the sunway.edu.np domain was performed to identify all accessible web pages, including the homepage, About Us, Programs, and Career sections. The process was configured to follow internal links and map the site's structure. 2. Phase 2: Targeted PDF Extraction: Given the scarcity of structured data on the main web pages, the methodology pivoted to identifying and analyzing downloadable documents. This included the use of text extraction tools to process the official college brochures (2022-23 and 2023-24), which proved to be the richest source of structured staff information. 3. Phase 3: Data Consolidation and Cross-Referencing: All data points extracted from various sources were consolidated into a single master dataset. A rigorous cross-referencing process was then performed to identify duplicate entries and resolve data discrepancies, such as the role-swapping detailed in the previous section. Data Cleaning & Normalization To ensure the final dataset is clean and consistent, a set of automated and manual data cleaning rules were applied. ● Name Normalization: Full names were converted to Title Case (e.g., manish maharjan became Manish Maharjan) to ensure a uniform presentation. ● Contact Validation: Email addresses were validated using a regular expression to confirm a valid format. Phone numbers were normalized to include the country code where possible (e.g., [PHONE] was noted as +977-1-4531725). ● Deduplication: Entries for the same individual were merged into a single, canonical record. Where conflicting information existed, the most recent and authoritative source was prioritized, and the discrepancy was documented in the notes field. Ethical Compliance The data collection was performed in strict adherence to industry ethical guidelines and the instructions provided in the query. ● Robots.txt Adherence: The reconnaissance tool was configured to respect the robots.txt file and did not attempt to crawl any disallowed directories. ● Polite Rate Limiting: A rate limit of one request per second was enforced to avoid placing an undue load on the college's web servers. ● Public Data Only: Extraction was limited to information explicitly provided for public consumption. No attempt was made to bypass authentication or access private data. No private mobile numbers or other highly sensitive information were found or extracted. ● Image Attribution: Photo URLs were included in the dataset where available, but no images were downloaded or redistributed.
