# Client Architecture Simplification

## Changes Made

### Overview
Simplified the client architecture by consolidating redundant wrapper scripts into a single, standalone client file.

### Files Removed
- `run_client.py` - Redundant wrapper script
- `client/` directory - Over-engineered module structure
  - `client/__init__.py`
  - `client/websocket_client.py`

### Files Added
- `client_simple.py` - Consolidated, standalone WebSocket client

## Why This Change?

### Problem
The previous architecture had unnecessary complexity:
```
run_client.py (wrapper)
    └── imports and calls client.websocket_client.py
        └── actual client implementation
```

This violated the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle by adding an extra layer of indirection without any benefit.

### Solution
Single file `client_simple.py` with all functionality:
- WebSocket client implementation
- Interactive mode for chat
- Test mode for pre-defined queries
- Single query mode for one-off questions
- Network configuration for remote connections

## Migration Guide

### Old Usage
```bash
# Old way
python run_client.py
python run_client.py test
```

### New Usage
```bash
# New way - same functionality
python client_simple.py
python client_simple.py test
python client_simple.py "What courses are offered?"
python client_simple.py --server ws://192.168.1.100:8000/ws
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: One file instead of three
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify
3. **Portability**: Single file can be copied to Termux or other devices
4. **Clarity**: No confusion about which file does what
5. **Network-Ready**: Built-in support for remote server connections

## Features in client_simple.py

### Three Operation Modes

1. **Interactive Mode** (default)
   ```bash
   python client_simple.py
   ```
   - Chat-like interface
   - Type queries, get responses
   - Type 'quit' or 'exit' to close

2. **Test Mode**
   ```bash
   python client_simple.py test
   ```
   - Runs pre-defined test queries
   - Useful for quick validation
   - Shows formatted responses

3. **Single Query Mode**
   ```bash
   python client_simple.py "Your question here"
   ```
   - Send one query and exit
   - Perfect for scripting
   - Fast and efficient

### Network Configuration

Connect to remote servers:
```bash
python client_simple.py --server ws://SERVER_IP:8000/ws
```

Default: `ws://localhost:8000/ws`

### Command-Line Arguments

- `query` (positional): Single query to send
- `--server`: WebSocket server URL
- No arguments: Enter interactive mode
- `test`: Run test queries

## Code Structure

```python
# Main components in client_simple.py

async def send_query(server_url, query)
    # Handles single query-response cycle
    
async def interactive(server_url)
    # Implements chat interface
    
async def test(server_url)
    # Runs pre-defined test queries
    
def main()
    # Argument parsing and mode selection
```

## Testing

Verify the new client works:

1. Start server:
   ```bash
   python run_server.py
   ```

2. Test each mode:
   ```bash
   # Interactive
   python client_simple.py
   
   # Test queries
   python client_simple.py test
   
   # Single query
   python client_simple.py "What is Sunway College?"
   ```

## Documentation Updates

All documentation has been updated to reference `client_simple.py`:
- README.md
- docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md
- docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md

## Future Considerations

This simplified architecture makes it easier to:
- Add voice interface features
- Integrate with mobile apps
- Deploy on resource-constrained devices (Termux)
- Extend with additional features without complexity

## Conclusion

The simplified client architecture follows best practices:
- ✅ KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- ✅ Single responsibility
- ✅ Easy to understand and maintain
- ✅ Portable and flexible
- ✅ Network-ready for distributed testing

No functionality was lost - all features remain available in the new `client_simple.py`.
